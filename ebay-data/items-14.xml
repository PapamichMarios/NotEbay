    <Description>~ Walt Disney's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST! VHS VIDEO TAPE ~ A modern movie masterpiece, Disney's Beauty and the Beast waltzed away with six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture -- the first ever for an animated film. Along with winning the prestigious Best Picture Golden Globe Award, it now ranks among history's most highly acclaimed cinematic achievements. When the film's beautiful book-loving heroine, Belle, sings the first of an unprecedented three Oscar-nominated songs, you too will fall instantly under its spell. However, it is the spell of an enchantress that opens this classic fairy talk, turning a cruel prince into a hideous beast. His stubborn pride compels him to remain in his bewitched castle -- inhabited by Lumiere the lovestruck candelabra, Cogsworth the pompous clock, the kindly Mrs. Potts, and an inquisitive little teacup named Chip. To break the spell, the Beast must win Belle's love before the last petal falls from an enchanted rose. With a colorful cast of endearing Disney characters, Beauty and the beast will enthrall both young and old, forever reminding us that true beauty comes from within. Tape in great condition - box in good shape. Approximate running time: 84 minutes - NTSC **I currently have several SALE items with low opening bids of $1.49** Please check my other auctions, if you're interested... I ACCEPT PAYPAL, BIDPAY, CHECKS (10 DAY WAIT FOR CHECKS TO CLEAR) AND MONEY ORDERS REMEMBER, WINNERS OF MULTIPLE AUCTIONS SAVE $$ in shipping! S&amp;H in the US is $3.50, slightly higher for international. Thanks for stopping by! ~Teresa~</Description>

I know there are those who can re-package items but this came from the estate of a gentleman who had 100's (even 1000's) of video tapes, many unopened. I have NO reason to believe this is not the original packaging. The box is in excellent condition and the tape should be as well! If there's a problem, I'll make it right! Priority Mail, usually at $3.95, is preferred for safety and speed; Insurance is at your option. Multiple wins can be shipped together to reduce postage charges! Use ebay's link above to check out the other tapes we're offering. Feel free to e-mail us with any questions, etc. We aren't set up to accept Credit Cards or "e-payments" such as PayPal ---Money Orders, cash, and personal checks are always accepted--if your _Feedback_ is over 100 with no recent _negatives_, we_ll even ship your tape(s) the next business day.

The movie stars Micheal Landon, Karen Grassle, Melissa Gilbert Melissa Sue Anderson. It also has a special guest star Ernest Borgnine. The movie is in wonderful shape. This is one of the all-time classic Little House on the prairie programs. Laura Ingalls learns an important lesson in love from a kind-hearted hermit (Ernest Borgnine), in the unforgettable THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD, a feature-length drama from "LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE". Laura (Melissa Gilbert), daughter of Charles and Caroline Ingalls (Michael Landon, Karen Grassle), is afraid the newest addition to her family, a baby boy, will replace her father's affections. When the baby becomes ill, Laura refuses to pray for the infant who eventually dies. Overwhelmed with guilt, Laura runs away to the mountains where shee meets and confides in Jonathan (Borgnine), a sensitive recluse. While caring for Laura, Jonathan helps the young girl to understand the death was not her fault, and that her family loves and needs her. Meanwhile, a panicked Charles searches in vain for Laura until an incredible sign leads him to her an emotionally charged reunion. Written and directed by Michael Landon, THE LORD IS MY SHEPHERD is superb entertainment for the entire family. You will not want to miss this classic. Buyer will pay $2.00 for shipping and handling.

    <Description>Elmo's World - Babies, Dogs &amp; More VHS NEW, Factory Sealed. This item is obtained directly from our authorized wholesale distributor. It is new and unopened, in the original factory shrink wrap. These are not dubbed or copied, but are the genuine products available here in the U.S. Please beware of others' "copied" products. Elmo's World - Babies, Dogs &amp; More VHS Set o Starring: Elmo o NTSC format (US and Canada only) o Color, Closed-captioned, NTSC Sesame Street's cheerful redhead chuckles his way through this delightful 50-minute compilation of three favorite "Elmo's World" episodes. First come the babies: real babies, Muppet babies, and animal babies. With help from Mister Noodle, a cast of Muppets, and video vignettes featuring humans, Elmo discovers what babies can do and how to play with them. Next come the dogs. Once again, Elmo's on the move--this time to share important tips about respecting the family pet. The final episode examines life on the farm. Viewers will observe youngsters accomplishing daily farm chores as well as Muppet farmers and barn animals punning around. As Elmo bops around his house (simply drawn and "furnished" with color crayon sketches), he chats with Dorothy the pet goldfish, poses questions to Mister Noodle, and tunes in to his friendly television for helpful cartoons presented by "The Baby Channel," "The Dog Channel," and of course, "The Farm Channel." Educational and entertaining for the younger crowd, each segment explores its topic using a variety of creative, quick-paced methods, enhanced by an upbeat soundtrack. From the moment we put this video in the VCR, my then-baby, now-toddler, loved this video. She runs up to the television to hug Elmo, and plays peek-a-boo with him in front of the set. When my husband or I are alone with her, we can pop the video in the VCR, put her in her crib, and take a quiet shower while she watches Elmo for 15 minutes. This is by far the best video we have for her, and highly recommend it to any parent who needs 5 or 10 minutes of "breathe time" to occupy an otherwise inconsolable toddler. Payment options: Mastercard/Visa or E-Check through PayPal Our PAYPAL account = dsc3@georgetown.edu Money order Cash Personal or cashier's check Payment options for International buyers : Mastercard/Visa or E-Check through PayPal Our PAYPAL account = dsc3@georgetown.edu International money order in U.S. dollars Cash in U.S. Dollars Check drawn from a U.S. Bank PAYMENT INSTRUCTIONS AFTER AUCTION END: Your total price = Auction Ending Price plus Shipping &amp; Handling Watch for an e-mail which will arrive soon after auction has ended This e-mail will contain all payment instructions you will need Please do not e-mail us asking us to confirm final price/payment details These details will be enclosed in the e-mail Payment needs to be received in 10 business days Buyer to pay $4.00 for shipping and handling within the U.S. Please click here to see my other similar items currently on auction.

    <Description>The Partridge Family was the '70s successor to the Monkees. Both were totally fictional rock/pop "bands" produced by Screen Gems, the television branch of Columbia Pictures. While the Monkees (TV series and band concept) were styled as mid-'60s counter-culture zaniness _ la the Beatles' film Hard Days Night, the Partridge Family was strictly wholesome with traditional family values despite the lite quasi-hip tone of the show. The top-rated series first-aired on ABC from 1970 to 1974, premiering September 25, 1970. Besides the face and voice of David Cassidy ,one of the other draws of the show was the uncanny deadpan timing of Danny Bonaduce as Danny Partridge and the simmering neurosis of the group's manager Reuben Kincaid as played by Dave Madden. When sharing a scene together, the two were hysterical. Starring stage and screen veteran Shirley Jones and then up-and-coming actor David Cassidy, The Partridge Family was loosely based on real-life family pop/rock band the Cowsills ("Hair," "The Rain, The Park &amp; Other Things," "Indian Lake," "Love American Style"). The other Partridge siblings were Susan Dey as Laurie, Suzanne Crough as Tracy, and Jeremy Gelbwaks as Chris during the first season. Gelbwaks' parents felt uncomfortable with the ensuing mania that surrounded the show and took the youngster out of the cast. He was replaced in the role by Brian Foster. Don't miss out on your chance to bid on this muscial cult favorite pictured here in their Mondrian-esque bus. This extremely rare reproduction is signed by Shirley Jones, Susan Dey &amp; David Cassidy &amp; is offered (here) at an unbelievable low minimum bid. Winning bid to add $5.00 for postage &amp; handling.

"The Creep," a rotting ghoul, waits behind young Billy at the newsstand for the latest issue of the "Creepshow" comic book. As Billy runs to keep out of the clutches of the town bullies, the Creep follows him, picking up his scattered comic book pages. Dramatized are three gruesome horror stories. In "Old Chief Wood'n head," a cigar store wooden Indian comes to life to avenge the store owner's brutal murder at the hands of three punks; "The Raft" involves four teenagers who encounter a terrifying, man-eating oil slick on a deserted lake; and "the Hitchhiker" is the chilling tale of a woman who keeps running into and over the same mutilated man on a lonely road. Finally, little Billy's troubles end when he leads the bullies into a patch of giant Venus flytraps. Don't Delay BUY TODAY._ Paypal .com - the online money order auction payment service.

Diego's a seductive, gay artist with "subversive" political leanings. When their paths cross, worldly Diego's determined to befriend -- and, if possible -- seduce the gullible revolutionary. Intrigued by Diego's wit, creativity and candor, David goes against the advice of his schoolmate Miguel who warns him that Diego's an "undesirable" in Cuban society. After David meets Diego's friends Germ n and Nancy, he's so intellectually stimulated by this circle, he returns to his own creative endeavors. Soon militant officials get wind of Diego's radically avant-garde practices, and trouble looms for both men. Academy Award Nominations: Best Foreign Film.

    <Description>ASTERIX AND OBELIX TAKE ON CAESAR - VHS video (NTSC) Written and Directed by Claude Zidi Starring: Christian Clavier, Gerard Depardieu and Roberto Benigni... Running Time: 106 min Rather than revealing any of the numerous incidents in the story, let's just say that Asterix, Obelix, the brave Gauls and the mean Romans are in it as well as the whole host of Rene Goscinny and Albert Uderzo original characters (including Dogmatix). All playing their traditional roles. For the first time Asterix will swing into battle with Obelix... Obelix will turn Asterix in to the Romans... Asterix will restore the fallen Ceasar to power... Tunnabrix will steal the Roman tax collector's chest, only to have it stolen from him in turn... And the magic potion will be replaced by Mathusalix's super-magic-potion... So is this Asterix turned inside out? Certainly not. Everybody is completely in character, but... Well, it's too complicated. It takes a whole movie to explain. This French comedy is dubbed in English and not available in the United States in any media (VHS, DVD or laserdisc). Click here for more information about this movie. The video is widescreen (letterbox) with dolby surround sound. This video is NTSC format for play on American TVs and VCRs. No artwork. Buyer pays shipping. $5 priority mail (USPS).

    <Description>FRONT ROW ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS "DRUNKEN MASTER" LETTERBOXED EDITION Starring JACKIE CHAN See the movie that propelled Jackie Chan to stardom. Truly a classic and a must see film for Jackie Chan fans around the world. Jackie Chan stars as Freddy, a wisecracking but good-hearted young man. One day he beats a local bully who was harassing a poor man in the market. The bully's father complains to Freddy's father, insisting on repayment of the damages done. Freddy has already been a handful for his father, Master Wong, so this latest incident is the last straw. In order to teach Freddy a lesson, Master Wong seeks out Sam Seed, a hard-driving kung-fu master who has a reputation for breaking his students. Freddy's friends warn him about the teacher's reputation so he heads for the hills. Unfortunately the eccentric old man he meets in a restaurant just happens to be Sam Seed himself. Seeds drills Freddy mercilessly for months, and Freddy makes many attempts to escape. Eventually Sam Seed shares the secret of his unusual fighting style-liquor! Filled with the spectacular stunts and broad slapstick that have become Jackie Chan's trademark, DRUNKEN MASTER is a hilarious and appealing martial arts film.

    <Description>This is a NO RESERVE, 5-DAY auction for a special set of items that are sure to become collectibles! There isn't a store anywhere in town that isn't sold out of these. YES, THERE'S STILL TIME TO GET IT BEFORE CHRISTMAS!! I will ship IMMEDIATELY, the SAME DAY if at all possible. This is so cool! Here are the much sought after Bernie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Gringott;s Coins Bubble Gum, Flying Key Flicker Pop, and Harry's Wizard Wand Candy!! The very best thing about each one of these is that they are all in packages that become toys themselves--no throwaway paper packaging here! Bernie Bott's Beans come in a brick red fabric bag with the logo printed on one side and tied with a sky blue drawstring, perfect for keeping Harry Potter trading cards in! Gringott's Coins Bubble Gum come in a blue transparent fabric mesh bag tied with a black drawstring. There are five pieces of bubble gum inside, three small bronze coins, two medium silver ones and two large gold coins. What better place to keep your casting stones in! The Flying Key Flicker Pop is really a high quality toy key with a little Harry Hologram in the center-- the picture doesn';t do it justice, it's amazing and there are many different pictures! The Wand is also a toy-- the candy inside it is little red lightening bolts, and the end pops out with a flick of the wrist as you cast your spell!! This is the perfect gift for the Harry Potter fan in your life! This same set plus an extra lollipop and a basket sells for 46.50 at the Candy Depot. I accept Paypal (my personal fave!) cashier's checks, money orders, or use Checkout if that is what YOU prefer. I ship Priority mail, which will usually get it to you in 2-3 days. And the charge? A mere $4.00! Good luck, happy bidding and have a GREAT holiday!! On</Description>

    <Description>William Auerbach-Levy (1889-1964) VICTOR BORGE IN CONCERT 1945 Born in Russia, Auerbach-Levy spent his career in New York City during the golden age of celebrity caricature in the first half of the 20th Century. In those years, caricaturists found an avid audience in the readers of magazines including VANITY FAIR and THE NEW YORKER. It was the beginning of the modern cult of celebrity. Auerbach-Levy was in the center of the action in New York and drew caricatures of some of the most famous celebrities of the day. This is a high quality lithographic poster published in 1977 promoting the Auerbach-Levy collection of drawings at the Museum of the City of New York. Auerbach-Levy's original drawing from 1924 was deftly executed with brush and ink. The freshness of his brushstrokes and line are beautifully captured by the lithography of the original. Overall size is 28" by 22". Condition: 33 year old poster, paper has slightly greyed. This piece is printed on high-quality paper. It far exceeds the quality of a normal poster. Buyer to add $6 for Priority Mail shipping within the U.S. (Canada $8; All other international $25). This is the only shipping charge for 1 to 100 prints.

This has eight characters on it, and double sided, both sides have the same eight characters, from Frankenstein, Dracula, Laurel and Hardy, and others(maybe you know who they are). We can't decide the other characters. The top of the lamp is an old style film maker (camera) with the handle. This is approx. 30 inches tall without a shade on it(doesn't come with a shade or bulb). There are some paint chips, which I am sure could be touched up. There is a chip in the camera itself, maybe a small fill in and a touch of paint. The pink hat on the woman has also got a small chip, I would say same as camera(could be fixed nicely). There are no actual Cracks anywhere that I have found. I think it is a Wonderful memorabilia item for the movie lovers out there!! Payment can be made with credit card/checks via Paypal, Money order, cashiers check can be mailed. Take a look and see what you think. Sorry about the glare in some of the pictures. Buyer pays shipping (and insurance if desired) for this heavy piece. Have a Great Day and Happy Bidding!!!</Description>

    <Description>Angie (1994) Geena Davis, James Gandolfini Previously viewed VHS tape; original tape in very good playing condition; original box is missing, cardboard sleeve provided to protect box. Description: In Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, a woman does what she's expected to--especially if she's expecting. Angie (Geena Davis) is just a little too independent for that, and when her long-time boyfriend gets her pregnant she decides to do things entirely her own way, shocking everyone in this often comedic look at one woman's search for self. This heartwarming story is based on the novel ANGIE, I SAYS by Avra Wing. Apparently Madonna was up for the role of Angie and was dismissed in favor of Geena Davis. The rumor is that Madonna therefore wrote an angry, sarcastic letter on this topic to Disney, and producer Joe Roth, claiming she had initiated the project with writer Todd Graff. Disney maintained that Madonna, attached from the beginning, had opted to do the film SNAKE EYES (aka DANGEROUS GAME) instead.James Gandolfini (Vinnie) and Aida Turturro (Tina) played brother and sister on the HBO series THE SOPRANOS. Rated R and 108 Minutes. PayPal, Billpoint, Bidpay, CCNow, cash (USA Currency), check (drawn on USA financial institution) or money orders are accepted.

The first, Magnetic Rose, is about the legacy of an opera singer, and the terrible secret she leaves in space, as the crew of a salvage ship must try to find a way to survive entering her memories.

Cannon Fodder revolves around the life of a boy who lives in a socialist city of cannons, where everyone's place and duty is set for life. Otomo himself is credited as director for the third segment, acting as supervisor for the first two. Memories is INCREDIBLE, while the writing and stories are truely unique and well done.

This video is BRAND NEW and still sealed in the factory wrap. The holidays are not very far away and this video would make a great stocking stuffer! Box description: When Big Bird wakes up feeling sick, Maria takes him to the hospital. It_s pretty frightening at first, but he soon learns that everyone at the hospital is working to make him feel better. Come along with Big Bird as the doctors and nurses at the hospital give him a blood test, an x-ray, and his own special ID bracelet. With everyone_s help, Big Bird discovers that the hospital isn_t so scary after all, and he makes a healthy return home to all his friends on Sesame Street.

    <Description>WOW! Super Rare- This is an absolutely incredible piece of motion picture history! This contact sheet contains 19 frame by frame pictures from the TITLE SCENE! Frames 6718-6736 clearly depict Lucille Ball and Robert Preston singing and dancing to the title song, Mame. The sheet is 11" x 14", and each frame is 2.5" x 1.75" This contact sheet is dated 4-6-73, and was used by those promoting the movie to determine which shots would be used for publicity pictures. Some of the frames have orange crayon markings on them, to distinguish frames which would not be used in the final prints. Frame 6735 contains a double hole punch beneath it, as well as two ruled pen markings (one on each side). The sheet itself is in nice condition, though the backside has some minor folding along one edge. The scan doesn't do it justice, because the whole sheet was too large for my scanner. There are an additional 7 and a half frames that did not fit in the scan. This is an unbelievable piece, and extremely rare! If you are a motion picture collector or Lucille Ball collector, you have just struck gold! This is a unique item that you can add to your collection, and be relatively sure there is nothing else quite like it! Buyer to pay shipping. International shipping will be higher. Payment Due within 10 days of auction end. PayPal, BidPay, BillPoint and Money Orders for payment.</Description>

    <Description>You are bidding on a previously viewed laserdisc of Ingmar Bergman's "The Magic Flute" with the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. No Reserve!!! Mozart's "The Magic Flute" premiered in 1791, and to this day it remains as one of the most delightfully humorous and enchanting operas of all time. Mozart tells the story of a handsome young prince's quest to save a beautiful princess from the forces of evil. It's a marvelous tale of mysticism, good vs. bad, and the power of love. This filmed version conceived, produced and directed by master filmmaker Ingmar Bergman, is a one of a kind joyous tribute to Mozart's musical mastery. 2 DISCS. 1973, Color, 134 minutes, Stereo. Performed In Swedish With English Subtitles. A GREAT laserdisc to add to any collection! Lucky Bidder pays $7 additional for priority shipping, insurance and delivery confirmation WITHIN the United States. Thank You and Good Luck!</Description>

In the Urusei Yatsura episode where Lum decides to 'help' with one of her alien gadgets due to a local rain storm, Ataru tries to rescue Lum from drowning underwater thereby "proving" his love for Lum._ At least that's her version._ Of course, in the end she really didn't need his help and ends up 'lightning blasting' her way out of the underwater entrapment and rescuing him. - Cel No. 1 has the 3 layers designated C9, B4, A5 - Cel No. 2 has the 3 layers designated as C24, B6, A3 - Cel No. 3 has the 3 layers designated as C23, B5, A4. These 3 cels of Lum rescuing are quite unique, and combined with a tall frame or some other display would make a really nice showpiece. _ _ ______ For higher quality; slower load pics, click here.

    <Description>Movies SERGEANT YORK New and Factory Sealed With a backbone made strong from tilling rocky farmland, a trigger finger made precise by hunting wild game, it's no wonder that Alvin C. York became a superior soldier. In fact, despite his moral objection to war, York became the most decorated man of WW I, earning his medals on the battlefields of Argonne when he single-handedly extinguished a German machine gun squadron armed with only a Springfeild rifle and a Colt .45 pistol. A pacifist turned patriot, York became not only a daring freedom fighter, but also one our nation's most revered heroes! Based on a true story and nominated for 11 Academy Awards, this "powerful and engrossing" (Look) WW I classic is an honest and fitting tribute to heroism that is further distinguished by the Oscar winning performance of the remarkable Gary Cooper. Gary Cooper Walter Brennan Joan Leslie George Tobias Stanley Ridges FACTS FROM THE VAULT Because WW II was approaching, York, after holding out for 23 years, agreed to let his life story be told on the condition that Gary Cooper play the lead. Mounted on a steel turntable so that 16 angles of it could be filmed, the 40-foot peak that york ascends to contemplate war was built from canvas and wood Select battle scenes were shot on an 80-acre barley farm that was strewn with charred tree trunks and made to look war-torn by five tons of dynamite.

Kyoji, the only member of a small Kendo (traditional Japanese wooden swordplay) club has his world turned upside down! Sudden visions of past life events during the age of the Incas revive ancient rivalries and ambitions, clouding modern day relationships and turning friends into deadly enemies!

However, he also remembers it was the betrayal of Biruka, Kyoji's past life, that thwarted his original attempt! Does the past really play an important role in the future? Nazca is a story of past lives and present conflicts. A story of friendships shattered and reformed by events that happened hundreds of years ago during the days of the Incas!

Walt Disney himself introduces the episodes and film critic Leonard Maltin provides background. The 2-disc set comes in a shiny metal case stamped as a limited edition (150,000 made), plus a collectible lithograph. The perfect holiday gift for your favorite Disney fan. Buyer pays $5 shipping. Online payments will get it in your hands in time for holiday giving. Check my other auctions to bid on the other colections in this Disney set: DAVY CROCKETT (Fess Parker as the coonskin cap hero), SILLY SYMPHONIES (animation classics) and MICKEY MOUSE IN LIVING COLOR, a colection of rare Mickey adventures.

" " From the broad strokes to the fine points, Tim Conway teaches golf the "Derk Dorf way" and ... we promise you ... your game will never be the same. " " In DORF ON GOLF, an athlete of some stature gives you startling insights (and ridiculous conclusions!) You'll see Dorf's revolutionary inventions that keep heads down, elbows in and drives straight and true. " " You'll meet Derk's "helpers," the bodacious Boom Boom LaRue and his erstwhile caddy, Leonard - tall as a tree and just as intelligent. (These folks give new meanings to the word "handicap") " " From tee to green, Derk shows you how to dress, how to drive, how to putt, how to cheat, how to find the 19th hole. He'll show you how to warm up, how to cool down and how to lose your cool. " " As a famous golfer once said, " Golf's too important to take seriously." If you (or the golfer in your life) are really serious about golf, DORF ON GOLF is the perfect antidote.

    <Description>This Warner Bros. 100 minute, color, VHS video with Dolby Surround sound, entitled, "Singles", is in excellent condition having only been played a few times. A stellar cast joins writer/director Cameron Crowe (Jerry Maguire) in this sweet, funny, romantic comedy of Seattle twentysomethings searching for - and running from - love. Among the players: Matt Dillon as a romantically aloof rocker, Bridget Fonda as a lovestruck neighbor who hopes to get him to change his tune, plus Kyra Sedgwick, Campbell Scott, Sheila Kelly, and Bill Pullman. Adding to the excitement of "Singles" in its much-acclaimed million-selling Epic Soundtrax album, Seattle superstars Alice In Chains and Soundgarden perform live, members of Pearl Jam appear in cameos, and many other top bands including Paul Westerberg, Screaming Trees, Chris Cornell, Smashing Pumpkins, Mudhoney, Mother Loves Bone, The Lovemongers, and Jimi Hendrix, are featured throughout. Bonus: Two favorite outtake scenes of writer/director Cameron Crowe follow the feature. Rated PG-13 for language. Payment is due within 10 days of auction closing.

    <Description>Untitled Document Cuban movie posters feature vibrant colors and an unusual look, making them almost appear to be hand-painted works of art rather than silkscreen posters. The paint is applied with heavy coats and the effect is quite striking. Cuba is still producing some of these posters and the process is totally hand made. I divided these posters in two categories: original and reprinted . Original posters were printed the year the artist designed them, in small quantities (25-250) and most will not be reprinted again due to many factors (copyright legalities on the movie, lost of original screen etc).These are the most valuable for the collectors. Small tears around the white borders and yellowish color of the paper are considered normal for these original posters. Notice that these posters, unlike U.S movie posters are NOT folded and I send them rolled and ready to frame, eliminating the need of mounting on linen to be displayed. Reprints are newer posters produced by ICAIC (Cuban Institute of Art and Cinema) after 1995 when the cuban government began to sell to tourists. They are equally beautiful and impresive, hand made and limited in their editions. In 1991, the Center for Cuban Studies in New York spearheaded a successful lawsuit against the U.S. Treasury Department, which made the importation and sale of original art from Cuba legal. I do not sale cuban posters for a living. My husband and I have a very large collection that we adquired in Cuba and some other countries. We also trade with other collectors around the world. We only sell those we have duplicates and we use that money to adquire more posters for our collection. Title: Jinete Fantasma (Ghost Horserider) Year: 1971. (original) Artist: Munoz Bachs Medium: Silkscreen . Cuban posters feature vibrant colors and an unusual look, making them almost appear to be hand-painted works of art rather than printed posters. The paint is applied with heavy coats. The effect is quite striking. Condition: Very Good (note that small tears around white borders, yellowish color of the paper (when original first run) and small imperfections in the inks are often normal in cuban posters since they are handmade.If some other imperfections are present I will write it as part of the description.Truly collectable and beautifully preserved. Payment methods : Money orders, checks, Billpoint (for credit card users) and PayPal (cubanposters@aol.com) name: Irina. Please , after end of auction I normally contact the highest bidder but sometimes I have to handle so many auctions that I loose track. Try to make contact with me at the end of the auction. Shipping: United States $7 priority mail w/ confirmation receipt--- International $15 airmail (I am not responsible for lost items in other countries but I always ask for a receipt of mailing as proof) ---- International with insurance $25 (I will return money or replace poster) YOU ONLY HAVE TO PAY THIS ONE TIME CHARGE NO MATTER HOW MANY POSTERS YOU BUY AS THEY CAN BE SHIPPED TOGETHER ,SO PLEASE LOOK AT : MY OTHER AUCTIONS Collecting cuban posters is a good investment idea and still inexpensive compared to high art. They are getting more and more scarce by the day and many of them are reaching very high prices. Cuba will eventually stop producing these wonderful posters because their limitations and cost. Any of these posters will make an unusual gift . For more information and facts about cuban posters please visit my webpage at: www.artofcuba.com Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>One Of Our Aircraft Is Missing VHS. This video is brand spanking new and is STILL FACTORY SEALED. Starring Godfrey Tearle and Eric Portman. 1941. 106 minutes. Black &amp; White. REVIEW: The year: 1941 The day: Sunday The hour: Morning 04:31 hours This is the story of B for Bertie, a British Bomber that was struck by artillery fire over Stuttgart, Germany. The six man crew was able to turn the plane toward Holland before they were forced to bail out. They came down in the Netherlands within miles of the Zuider Zee. With the determined assistance of the Dutch resistance the entire crew is passed from hand to hand through the German lines until they reached the North Sea. Soon they were back in England. The Dutch have a saying.... the sea is a common enemy and against a common enemy one must unite. Five of the Dutch resistance were executed for the assistance that they gave to the British Air Crew. The attached picture will tell the rest of the story. NO RESERVE! YOUR FIRST BID COULD BE THE WINNING BID!!!!! WINNING BIDDER PLEASE INCLUDE $3.50 FOR SHIPPING AND HANDLING. PAYPAL IS ACCEPTED. THANKS AND HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!!!</Description>

    <Description>STAR TREK Boxed set of Star Trek movies Perfect Christmas Present for your favorite Star Trek fan!! Six movies including: Star Trek--The Motion Picture: The crew of the Enterprise is reunited to combat a lethal force field headed toward Earth. Slow, talky, and derivative, somewhat redeemed by terrific special effects and majestic Jerry Goldsmith score; still, mainly for purists. Network and videocassette version--generally considered an improvement--runs 143m. Followed by many sequels--and several new TV series! Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan: Kirk and the Enterprise crew must do battle with the nefarious villain of 1967's ``Space Seed'' episode. A bit hokey and pretentious at times, but a likable adventure overall, with nice touches of warmth and humor. Footage added for network showings. Originally released without the ``II'' in its title. Star Trek III: The Search for Spock: Picking up where #2 left off, Kirk reassembles his crew and shanghais the Enterprise to try and rescue Spock--in whatever form he may still be alive--while both he and the rapidly destructing Genesis Planet are endangered by a Klingon warship (led by Lloyd, in an ineffectual performance). Subdued sci-fi outing very much in keeping with tone of the original TV series... and therefore, recommended most heartily to Star Trek fans. Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home: The Enterprise crew takes a sharp left turn toward comedy in this uncharacteristic--and very entertaining--movie. Story has the familiar characters time-traveling back to the 20th century in order to save the Earth of the future, with the help of some humpback whales. Sheer novelty of the comic tone excuses some forays into the obvious; it's all in fun. Star Trek V: The Final Frontier: The Enterprise crew takes off on an emergency mission when an apparent madman takes over a distant planet and holds its interstellar ambassadors hostage; his motives, however, turn out to be anything but terroristic. Dramatically shaky trek starts off with a case of the cutes, and gets worse before it (finally) gets better. A weak entry in the series. Shatner's feature-film directing debut; he also shares story credit. Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country: The Enterprise crew is assigned to negotiate truce with Klingon leader, only to fall prey to a trap set by one of his renegade cohorts (Plummer, in a deliciously flamboyant performance). Entertaining saga cowritten by director Meyer. Nimoy helped concoct the story and also executive produced. Video version has 2 minutes of additional footage.

    <Description>This is a terrific signed about 8x10/10x8 color glossy picture that is matted to an overall size of 11x14. This excellent matted picture is signed by Kenny Baker and he also wrote "R2-D2". I have many other signed and matted displays for auction on Ebay at incredibly low starting bids!! The matting alone costs more to have done at a frame shop than what my starting bid is!! A very attractive signed display piece. A truly fine addition to any collection. Perfect for any "Movie/T.V." fan or autograph collector. Any glare in the scan was caused by the protective cellophane to keep the item clean. Item is to large to fit entirely in the scan. Comes with a COA. S&amp;H is $5.00 in the U.S. Foreign orders require $9.00 S&amp;H. Japan/Asia part of the world requires $15.00 S&amp;H. Procedures---1. NO packages are mailed until payment is received, NO exceptions!! 2. All payments are in U.S. funds only!! I do NOT accept any foreign currency or payments that is not in U.S. currency 3. After an auction is over, Ebay allows 3 days(72 hours) for me to contact the winner. I will contact you with all mailing information and totals. 4. Online payment services such as Paypal, Bidpay, etc., are NOT accepted!! 5. I am glad to answer questions. When asking a question, you have to tell me what specific item the question is for and what you want to know. An e-mail saying "tell me more" does not enlighten me to the specific item you are referring to or what information you need to know, and these e-mails will not be answered. 6. I do not do direct sales. If you want an item, you must bid on it!! Please do not e-mail in attempts to work out deals on the side. 7. Payment is required within 10 days. Outside the U.S., payment is required within 15 days. Ebay is a great place to buy and sell--Please do not bid on an item if you are not going to pay for it!!!

    <Description>That Girl "Guest Stars" New, Factory Sealed Vhs! This compilation includes three episodes highlighting some of the great talents who appeared on THAT GIRL over the years. In "The Liggle Piggy Had A Ball," guest starring TERI GARR and ROB REINER, Ann is asked to accept a Toni Award for her friend who must fly to Hollywood on the day of the awards. But after reading an article about a man getting his toe stuck in a bowling ball, Ann is experimenting and gets her toe stuck too. When all efforts to free her foot fail, she is forced to thump her way up to the dais in a fancy hairdo, evening gown and bowling ball! Episode two, "Pass The Potatoes, Ethel Merman" finds Ann overwhelmed to be appearing in a walk-on part on stage with ETHEL MERMAN. After being tongue-tied and applauding inappropriately the first-day of rehearsals, Ann avoids Miss Merman in embarrassment. Donald, trying to be helpful, invites the star to dinner at Ann's apartment, where her presence attracts the attention of all the neighbors. In "Those Friars," Ann is surprised when her late Uncle Harry wills her his old trunk of stage clothes. But she is doubly surprised when celebrities MILTON BERLE and DANNY THOMAS pay a visit toher apartment and try to buy the trunk. Color/75 min./Not Rated; Condition: New.

    <Description>Pretty Woman Release Year: 1990 By: CAST: RICHARD GERE Publisher: Director: Garry Marshall Categories: Comedy, Romance Rated: (Brief Nudity, Adult Situations, Not For Children, Explicit Language, Profanity ) Running Time: 117 minutes Condition: EXCELLENT / PREVIOUSLY VIEWED Self-involved corporate raider Edward Lewis (Richard Gere has recently split up with his girlfriend. Seeking directions to the Beverly Hills Hotel, he makes the acquaintance of free-spirited hooker Vivian Ward (Julia Roberts and decides to put her on a $3000 retainer as his "date." He Cinderellarizes her by bankrolling a full wardrobe and cosmetic makeover. Of course, the set-up will be strictly platonic. A disarming modern-day fairy tale, Pretty Woman was the picture that made Julia Roberts a superstar. As charming as she is in her "giggling" sequences, Roberts' best scene is her triumphant return to a posh Rodeo Drive shop where she'd been previously snubbed. Keeping Pretty Woman afloat throughout is the buoyant direction of Garry Marshall and the always welcome presence of Marshall's stock company of actors, including Hector Elizondo as a stuffy but golden-hearted concierge. Pretty Woman began its life as a much darker story of prostitutes and homicidal drug dealers, but more box-office-savvy heads ultimately prevailed. Domestic Shipping, Handling and Materials: Priority Mail (2-3 days) $4.00. Book Rate (1-3 weeks) $2.00. Optional Insurance $1.10. To US Residents Only.

Butler - Set Designer Stephenie McMillan - Set Designer Ellen Mirojnick - Costume Designer John Mollo - Costume Designer Kevin Jewison - Camera Operator Keith Campbell - Stunts George Marshall Ruge - Stunts Neil Summers - Stunts Jim Wilkey - Stunts Brian Williams - Stunts Description: Partly based on Charlie Chaplin's My Autobiography, this humorous and dramatic biopic features an all-star cast including Oscar nominee Robert Downey, Jr., Dan Aykroyd, Anthony Hopkins, Kevin Kline, Diane Lane, and Chaplin's real life daughter, Geraldine Chaplin, who portrays his mentally ill mother. With the use of flashback, an elderly Chaplin discusses his autobiography with his editor (Hopkins), who urges him to be more vulnerable and emotionally honest with his memoirs while journeying through his poverty-stricken childhood, closest friendships, many marriages, merciless pursuit by J. Edgar Hoover (Kevin Dunn), and Chaplin's ingenious invention of "The Little Tramp." Highlighted works such as The Gold Rush (1925) and The Great Dictator (1940) illustrate significant turning points in Chaplin's prolific filmography. Director Richard Attenborough's film also explores the circumstances surrounding Chaplin's exile from America and his eventual return to receive an honorary Academy Award. ? (Synopsis by: Lisa Kropiewnicki) The Academy Award-winning director of another biopic, Gandhi (1982), Richard Attenborough reveals his obvious reverence for the iconoclastic Charlie Chaplin in this critically if not commercially successful film. Robert Downey, Jr., who trained for over a year to replicate Chaplin's English cockney accent, tics and rhythm as well as his graceful balletic and athletic movements, physical humor, and posture, gives the star-making performance of his career and is riveting to watch as he brings to life one of the most influential people in the history of cinema. The film is a thoughtful mixture of melancholy and humor, juxtaposing Chaplin's private loneliness and loss with his professional comedic talents and fortitude. Spanning a period of nearly 80 years in the actor's life, the film has been criticized for trying to cover too much narrative ground, but given the enormity of Chaplin's contribution to his art and the personal obstacles he overcame, this is an enjoyable, emotional, and authentic film. From its rural Hollywood locations in the early 1900's and demonstration of early movie-making techniques to its superb cast, Chaplin (1992} is a potent tribute to a gifted cinematic artist. ?

    <Description>This incredible box set contains 7 VHS tapes (740 minutes in total) of one of the greatest television miniseries of all time -- I, Claudius. This superbly acted, mordantly funny romp through 70 years or so of Roman history is one of the best-loved miniseries ever made, and deservedly so. Derek Jacobi plays Roman Emperor Claudius, who reflects in old age on his life and his remarkable family, giving us a history lesson that's unlike anything you learned in school. The story begins in 24 B.C. during the reign of Augustus Caesar, Rome's first emperor, and ends in A.D. 54 with Nero on the throne. In between, I, Claudius details the scheming, murder, madness, and lust that passed for politics in the early years of the Pax Romana. Further acting honors go to George Baker as Tiberius and to John Hurt as a hilarious and absolutely terrifying Caligula. The topnotch cast and the incident-filled plot are more than enough to hold the attention through almost 11 hours of gripping, deliciously wicked Roman follies. This particular box set is in mint condition, as it has hardly been used. The tapes are all in perfect working order, and the box looks new. All in all, this collection is a wonderful addition to the library of any fan of historical drama and intrigue.

    <Description>You're bidding a rare 60 minute retrospective, and one of the best "making of" videos I've ever scene -from the current revival of the great classic -"42nd Street". Great perfomance footage highlight this presentation, as well as interviews with the many celebs in attendance (Liza Minelli, Tommy Tune, Rosie O'Donell, Jerry Orbach), cast member interviews, and and a complete retrospective on the history of the show from it's original 1930's stage production all the way thru the current Broadway revival. The story of a girl from the sticks who comes to NY with a pair of tap shoes and a dream is a timeless human drama, and this wonderfully shot piece will leave you moved. The "Lullabye of Broadway" segment alone is worth the price of admission. Don't pass it up. Buyer pays $4 shipping. Good luck!

    <Description>One of a set issued by Blatz Gum, 20 such pictures all told in a complete set. Most ,or all of them, listed on reverse, came from the silent era. Ben Lyon was a big star in his day, appeared in over 75 films beginning in silent era and running up to early 1940's. On reverse there is some kind of an age type stain but because front is done in black it isn't visible there and doesn't interfere with the picture. Someone would mail in 10 Blatz wrappers and would be entitled to an album in which to mount the pictures. All writing on the back is easily legible.

    <Description>ROMANCING THE STONE: One Reviewer Wrote: "Director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump, Contact) had a hit with this 1984 comedy that first teamed Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny DeVito. Turner steals the show from the guys, however, playing a pushy romance novelist who gets stuck among some dangerous figures in Colombia and has only a rumpled guide (Michael Douglas) as an ally. The chemistry between the stars is infectious (the trio went on to make a sequel, Jewel of the Nile, and then an interesting, dark comedy directed by DeVito, The War of the Roses). Zemeckis--whose specialty at the time was creating set pieces of raucous action (as in his Back to the Future)--keeps things hopping with lots of kinetic material. " Star Trek First Contact (c)1996 PG-13 111 Mins Starring: Patrick Stewart, Jonathan Frakes, James Cromwell previous rental. Synopsis: They call themselves the Borg - a half-organic, half-machine collective with a sole purpose: to conquer and assimilate all races. Led by their seductive and sadistic queen (Alice Krige), the Borg are headed to Earth with a devious plan to alter history. Picard's last encounter with the Borg almost killed him. Now, he wants vengeance. But how far will he go to get it? The Jewel of the Nile (1985) ( USA NTSC VHS Movie ) More thrilling comedy and hilarious adventure in "Romancing the Stone''s" hit sequel. Here Kathleen Turner, Michael Douglas and Danny DeVito find themselves in the middle of an Arabian revolution and must locate the mysterious "jewel." Chases, laughs, romance and danger galore. 106 min.

    <Description>Robert DeNiro, Edward Norton, Angela Bassett and Marlon Brando team up in THE SCORE an intriguing crime thriller that marks the first time that legendary Oscar winners Robert DeNiro and Marlon Brando have shared the screen. Also starring Oscar nominees Edward Norton and Angela Bassett. I don't want to give away too much of the plot as this film is one of the smartest, most entertaining crime capers ever filmed, with surprises at every turn. When expert safecracker Nick Wells (DeNiro) decides it might be time to settle down with his girlfriend (Angela Bassett), his friend and business partner Max (Brando) has other plans. Heavily in debt to a crime boss, Max needs Nick to pull one last heist: help novice thief Jack Teller (Norton) steal a scepter worth $30 million from the House of Customs. Tempted by the $6 million payday, Nick reluctantly agrees to do the job. But what starts out as a safe bet turns into a high risk gamble when a clash of egos threatens to bring them all down. What ensues is a top-notch heist movie that ratchets up the tension inch by careful inch proving an ingenius suspense caper. DVD is new, factory sealed widescreen collection loaded with special features. Winner takes care of $5.95 USPS Priority Delivery Confirmation &amp; Handling. Recommended optional insurance is available at the additional cost of $1.10. Shipping is limited to within the USA. Winner to contact seller within three days of auction's close providing shipping information and should utilize checkout for convenient method of payment. Payment is welcome via eBay Payments, Paypal or Bid Pay. Personal checks are accepted only through eBay Payments by clicking on the electronic check icon. If mailing payment, winner agrees to pay by Money Order Only! (No personal checks can be accepted if mailing payment!) Bids placed by those with excessive negative or hidden feedback will NOT be honored. Any questions or further clarification should be addressed prior to bidding. All sales final. Take a look at my other auctions for films at bargain prices and save even more by reduced combined shipping costs. Good luck and Happy Holidays To All!</Description>

What you are Bidding On: #153 JIM THORPE ALL AMERICAN LC #2 '51 Type of Item: Original Vintage Theater-Used Lobby Card #2 (Measures 11" x 14") Description: Jim Thorpe - All American, the 1951 Michael Curtiz Olympic decathlon sports biography of Jim Thorpe (the greatest athlete of all time, even though he was stripped of his Olympic medals) starring Burt Lancaster, Charles Bickford, Steve Cochran, and Phyllis Thaxter Note that this lobby card shows Lancaster as Thorpe in full football uniform surrounded by other players. Condition &amp; Defects: very good. There is a tiny creased area in the right of the bottom border below the tiny writing at the bottom. There is a pinhole in the left corners and two in the top right corner. There is minor smudging in the blank borders and a stain in the right of the bottom blank border. Click here to learn how we describe the condition of our items. Lobby Cards measure 11" x 14" and were almost always printed in sets of 8 (some lower budget films only had a set of 4). Many lobby card sets (usually pre-1970 sets) have a "title card". A title card normally has artwork and the credits from the film, and is different in appearance from the other seven cards in the set. The artwork is usually the same as that of the artwork on one of the styles of half-sheet. It is very difficult to find complete lobby card sets from pre-1970 films, as almost all of these were long ago broken up and sold by the individual card. Click here to view the hundreds of other items we have for sale on eBay! Our Feedback Policy We only leave feedback on those who leave feedback on us. The reason we leave feedback in this manner is both because we don't consider a transaction "completed" until the buyer has decided they are happy with their purchase, and also because we sell so many items (usually 500+ a week) that it would require an extra employee if we had to leave feedback first, and that would mean raising our prices, which we don't want to do. All but a handful of our 10,000+ customers are understanding on this and are willing to leave feedback first. If you are one of the few people who insist on feedback being left as soon as you make payment, PLEASE DO NOT BID ON ANY OF OUR AUCTIONS. IMPORTANT! Please read our Shipping Terms before you place a bid on this item! U.S. only : Shipping is SEVEN DOLLARS ($7) , (unless the item is oversized, in which case shipping is $12, as would be clearly noted in the description above).

What you are Bidding On: #314 A &amp; C MEET THE INVISIBLE MAN LC #8 '51 Type of Item: Original Vintage Theater-Used Lobby Card #8 (Measures 11" x 14") Description: Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man, the 1951 Charles Lamont horror comedy (loosely based on the classic H.G. Wells novel) starring Bud Abbott, Lou Costello and Nancy Guild Note that this card actually shows the Invisible Man wrapped in bandages, along with both Abbott and Costello! Condition &amp; Defects: very good to fine. There is a pair of staple holes and a pencil mark in the top left corner and minor smudges in the blank borders. There are a few minor creases in the blank borders. Click here to learn how we describe the condition of our items. Lobby Cards measure 11" x 14" and were almost always printed in sets of 8 (some lower budget films only had a set of 4). Many lobby card sets (usually pre-1970 sets) have a "title card". A title card normally has artwork and the credits from the film, and is different in appearance from the other seven cards in the set. The artwork is usually the same as that of the artwork on one of the styles of half-sheet. It is very difficult to find complete lobby card sets from pre-1970 films, as almost all of these were long ago broken up and sold by the individual card. Click here to view the hundreds of other items we have for sale on eBay! Our Feedback Policy We only leave feedback on those who leave feedback on us. The reason we leave feedback in this manner is both because we don't consider a transaction "completed" until the buyer has decided they are happy with their purchase, and also because we sell so many items (usually 500+ a week) that it would require an extra employee if we had to leave feedback first, and that would mean raising our prices, which we don't want to do. All but a handful of our 10,000+ customers are understanding on this and are willing to leave feedback first. If you are one of the few people who insist on feedback being left as soon as you make payment, PLEASE DO NOT BID ON ANY OF OUR AUCTIONS. IMPORTANT! Please read our Shipping Terms before you place a bid on this item! U.S. only : Shipping is SEVEN DOLLARS ($7) , (unless the item is oversized, in which case shipping is $12, as would be clearly noted in the description above).

    <Description>Bruce Hershenson Vintage Movie Posters and Movie Poster Books All 530 items we are selling this week have a $2.99 opening bid and NO RESERVE! No questions asked return policy on EVERY item! Best Packaging and Quickest Shipping on eBay! 99.978% customers satisfied in over 42,000 eBay transactions! Full-Time movie poster dealer since 1989; over 16 million dollars of sales! Publisher of 30 full-color movie poster books (over 220,000 copies sold)! What you are Bidding On: #402 COMMANDO CODY 1sh '53 sci-fi serial! Type of Item: Original Vintage Theater-Used Chapter #4 Folded One-Sheet (27" x 41") Description: From Chapter #4 of Commando Cody, the 1953 Franklin Adreon, Fred C. Brannon, &amp; Harry Keller science fiction space serial starring Judd Holdren, Aline Towne, William Shallert, Richard Crane, and Grant Withers Condition &amp; Defects: very good. There is some staining in the left of the chapter title box. There are minor creases in the blank border and a tack hole in each corner of the image background. The top blank border was folded back at one time. A 1 1/2" x 4" piece was torn off the bottom left corner but it is held on with tape from the back. There is a piece off the top left corner. Click here to learn how we describe the condition of our items. One-Sheets are the standard movie poster size, what you see outside of any movie theater. From 1896 until roughly 1990, almost all actual theater-used one-sheets measured 27" x 41" (since then, most one-sheets measure 27" x 40"). Up until 1980 (or thereabouts) the vast majority of one-sheets were folded twice horizontally and once vertically (this is in no way considered a defect). Sometime during the late '70s, studios began printing one-sheets rolled. Most one-sheets after the mid-1980s are printed unfolded, though it is still possible to find some newer posters folded. Most newer one-sheets are printed double-sided (with a mirror image on the back) for use in a light box in front of the theaters. However, sometimes the studios print some posters single-sided. All of the one-sheets (unless otherwise noted) being sold by eMoviePoster are original vintage theater-used one-sheets! Click here to view the hundreds of other items we have for sale on eBay! Our Feedback Policy We only leave feedback on those who leave feedback on us. The reason we leave feedback in this manner is both because we don't consider a transaction "completed" until the buyer has decided they are happy with their purchase, and also because we sell so many items (usually 500+ a week) that it would require an extra employee if we had to leave feedback first, and that would mean raising our prices, which we don't want to do. All but a handful of our 10,000+ customers are understanding on this and are willing to leave feedback first. If you are one of the few people who insist on feedback being left as soon as you make payment, PLEASE DO NOT BID ON ANY OF OUR AUCTIONS. IMPORTANT! Please read our Shipping Terms before you place a bid on this item! U.S. only : Shipping is SEVEN DOLLARS ($7) , (unless the item is oversized, in which case shipping is $12, as would be clearly noted in the description above).

    <Description>Bruce Hershenson Vintage Movie Posters and Movie Poster Books All 530 items we are selling this week have a $2.99 opening bid and NO RESERVE! No questions asked return policy on EVERY item! Best Packaging and Quickest Shipping on eBay! 99.978% customers satisfied in over 42,000 eBay transactions! Full-Time movie poster dealer since 1989; over 16 million dollars of sales! Publisher of 30 full-color movie poster books (over 220,000 copies sold)! What you are Bidding On: #500 PROM NIGHT 1sh '80 Jamie Lee Curtis Type of Item: Original Vintage Theater-Used Folded One-Sheet (27" x 41") Description: Prom Night, the 1980 Paul Lynch teen slasher horror film starring Leslie Nielsen, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Casey Stevens Condition &amp; Defects: very good to fine. There are faint minor creases throughout the poster. There is a 1" tear in the left of the bottom blank border. Click here to learn how we describe the condition of our items. One-Sheets are the standard movie poster size, what you see outside of any movie theater. From 1896 until roughly 1990, almost all actual theater-used one-sheets measured 27" x 41" (since then, most one-sheets measure 27" x 40"). Up until 1980 (or thereabouts) the vast majority of one-sheets were folded twice horizontally and once vertically (this is in no way considered a defect). Sometime during the late '70s, studios began printing one-sheets rolled. Most one-sheets after the mid-1980s are printed unfolded, though it is still possible to find some newer posters folded. Most newer one-sheets are printed double-sided (with a mirror image on the back) for use in a light box in front of the theaters. However, sometimes the studios print some posters single-sided. All of the one-sheets (unless otherwise noted) being sold by eMoviePoster are original vintage theater-used one-sheets! Click here to view the hundreds of other items we have for sale on eBay! Our Feedback Policy We only leave feedback on those who leave feedback on us. The reason we leave feedback in this manner is both because we don't consider a transaction "completed" until the buyer has decided they are happy with their purchase, and also because we sell so many items (usually 500+ a week) that it would require an extra employee if we had to leave feedback first, and that would mean raising our prices, which we don't want to do. All but a handful of our 10,000+ customers are understanding on this and are willing to leave feedback first. If you are one of the few people who insist on feedback being left as soon as you make payment, PLEASE DO NOT BID ON ANY OF OUR AUCTIONS. IMPORTANT!
