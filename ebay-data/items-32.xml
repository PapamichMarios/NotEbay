    <Description>This is a fluffy chenille winter scarf that looks like it's trying to be a feather boa. Scarf measures a whopping 68" long, and I doubt it was ever worn. Feather boa like chenille scarf is in excellent shape. I invite you to CLICK HERE to see all the great items I am currently offering on eBay!! Because of the September 11th tragedies, I have changed some of my policies. Our mail is moving much slower now, so international bidders MUST now pay via PayPal or BidPay. Multiple item winners may have their items shipped together, BUT all items must be paid for in a timely manner. I WILL NOT extend payment due dates in order to wait for other auctions to close. Winners must respond to my confirmation e-mail within 3 days, or the item will be offered to the next highest bidder. Payment is to be received within 12 days of auction close, or a non-paying bidder alert will be filed, and the item will be offered to the next highest bidder or re-listed. If payment is not received within 15 days or the next highest bidder ends up with the item, you will receive an eBay warning as well as the appropriate feedback. US winners please also realize that it will take your payment longer to arrive. It will also take your package longer to get to you after I ship it. It took a priority mail package that I sent 6 days to arrive at its destination 70 miles from my home. I don_t see this situation improving anytime soon. Please send your payment as soon as you can after I contact you. I accept both e-checks and credit card payments through www.PayPal.com. Packages over 13.5 ounces must go priority mail. If your item weighs less than 13.5 ounces, you may choose between 1st class or priority mail. On 1st class shipments, the price of the envelope is included in the price I quote you. If paying by check, item ships after check clears. Shipping prices quoted at end of auction. Only US funds accepted. Ciao for now.</Description>

    <Description>*M* SEXY DESIGNER L'OREN Cami/Panty SET *NEW* Don't miss the eBay store where you can find items not visible in the auctions - even stuff on sale! This is a *brand new with tags* stretch camisole and boy leg panty set from Donna L'Oren Intimates. Very HIGH Quality. These pieces are semi-sheer deep gray with black dragon designs. A sophisticated look from this new French designer. Fabric is a unique stretchy 100% polyester. Washable. This set would make a wonderful gift! The pictures are slightly overexposed to show details. The set is a little darker than shown. Color Gray/Black Size Medium This set is available in Small, Medium, and Large auctions this week. Everything I sell is brand new and first quality - guaranteed! PayPal, BillPoint or Money Orders are fine, but no checks please! Take advantage of flat rate Priority Mail shipping! One flat fee of $3.95 covers any number of small items purchased within a 7 day period. Larger items like dresses, suits, coats, robes, etc. may cost a little extra. This will be noted in the description. First Class Shipping Available Upon Request. I only ship within the US - but I ship FAST! I work hard to resolve any problems you may have. I tried a no returns policy for a short time, but I heard you! OK! Since it's nearly impossible to decide if a bra is going to fit without trying it on, and it's not fair to allow returns on some things but not others, please feel free to return anything within 10 days of receipt. I will do a refund or exchange excluding shipping costs. However, please work with me on this. It takes a lot of extra time to handle returns, so try to be sure you want the item before bidding. If you are unsure of size, please refer to the size chart on my "about me" page. It is within 1/2" of the manufacturer's specs. I will, of course, also gladly issue a refund or exchange if I have made a mistake or there is a flaw in the item. Fair enough? Need size help?

    <Description>This Chanel handbag was bought about 4 years ago by me at Neiman Marcus in King Of Prussia. It originally sold for $1,000.+++. I used it for a week and put it away and forgot about it! This is not a dress bag, but an everyday bag. The color you see in the pictures is the color that it is, kinda a brownish color with a grained texture to it. It measures 8" tall and 9" across. The should handles measure 12" (24" total). This bag has the Chanel gold chain looping around the bottom of the handles, attaching to the leather top part. The handbag has two outer pockets on either side with two zipped pockets on the inside. You can clearly see the Chanel Logo along the bottom of the bag. It comes with the charge card type coa with it's number along with the signature black bag and black box. This is not the usual old Chanel handbag! I accept Pay Pal and money order. Payment is expected within 10 days of auctions end. Buyer pays s/h fee of $10.00 (The original black box is very large)! Thanks for looking.</Description>

PayPal, BillPoint or Money Orders are fine, but no checks please! Take advantage of flat rate Priority Mail shipping!

This will be noted in the description. First Class Shipping Available Upon Request. I only ship within the US - but I ship FAST! I work hard to resolve any problems you may have. I tried a no returns policy for a short time, but I heard you! OK!

I will do a refund or exchange excluding shipping costs. However, please work with me on this. It takes a lot of extra time to handle returns, so try to be sure you want the item before bidding.

I will, of course, also gladly issue a refund or exchange if I have made a mistake or there is a flaw in the item. Fair enough? Need size help?

A+++ This brand new women's large suede belted 3/4 length jacket sells for $179 in many better stores. This is not a patchwork jacket. We work directly with the manufacturer and cut out all the "middlemen" that add their profit each step along the way. Many of these better leather jackets go through as many as 4 levels of distributors before they get to the retail store. We have a streamlined operation with very little overhead. This keeps your cost as low as possible!! All of our products are guaranteed. If your jacket doesn't fit, you can exchange it for a better fitting jacket. To ensure that you receive the correct fit, please refer to the size chart below. We offer 100% customer satisfaction!

    <Description>This ivory or offwhite heavy silk evening jacket is made by Jim Heilman in China. I would call this a unisex jacket, in that a woman could wear it as a wrap or evening jacket, and a smaller man could wear it as quite a "spiffy" smoking jacket. Very nice rounded, textured lapels. 40" bust, 40" waist, 2 pockets with bands that match the lapels, 18.5" inner sleeve, 24.5" outer sleeve, 18" around arm hole, 14" bicep, 15.5" across shoulder, 30.5" length. The light in the photo yellows the color, but it is actually a pure ivory or off-white shade. I think the third photo is the closest. Other than being slightly wrinkled, looks just "off the rack." There is a TINY ink mark on one sleeve. Chances of anyone even noticing that mark are slim, and it will most probably come out with dry cleaning. Also, under the same sleeve, there are some 3 tiny dark dots that may have come from either an ink or straight pin. Again, they are under the arm, and they will most probably come out when dry cleaned. At this price, it is worth the investment to get a fine quality custom silk jacket. Please note that I ship only to the U.S. and accept only U.S. funds as payment. The address must include a street, city and state or a verified post office box. At this point, unfortunately, my method of postage will not accommodate APO addresses. In some cases, I will work with International bidders if they are willing to pay actual shipping and a higher handling charge. We need to work that out by email prior to the bid. Have you thought about using eBay for your Christmas gifts? You can stretch your shopping dollars a great deal! Following is my Seller's info that applies to all items. (Please click on View Seller's Other Auctions or search by Seller ID Duckfeed to keep up with my offerings. My auctions end at all different times, including daytime hours.) I will combine items for shipping to save you money. My maximum hold on items while waiting for other auctions to finish is 7 days. Payment is expected within TEN (10) days of close of sale. Please be sure to list item name and item number on Paypal or Billpoint, or with your money order or check. All items are sold "as is" with no returns. See my high-volume positive feedback, and you will see that I sell quality merchandise. I accept Billpoint, Paypal, money orders (and checks with hold if you have a lot of positive eBay feedback). Clothing I sell can be described as "better quality" clothing of a designer name brand purchased in Nordstroms, Macys, Saks, Niemans, Grodins, Talbots, Casual Corner, Ann Taylor, etc. All items are used, and most items look new. See my other auctions. I don't put anything on auction that I would not wear myself or ask my man-friend to wear. I have a long time corporate background and know what career clothing comprises the "dress for success" look. I am human and do my very best to represent items honestly, point out any flaws I find, and leave you feeling great about what you buy. I work very hard to offer consistent positive customer service. If I miss an obvious flaw in my description, I will deal with you with integrity. Colors are sometimes distorted, as it's hard to get all the software to work together with total accuracy. I try to describe colors. YOU MAY NEED TO DRY CLEAN OR LAUNDER THE ITEM, according to its label instructions, although some items will not need it. Because my profit margin is low and because the items usually get pretty wrinkled in transit, I do not invest in dry cleaning most items prior to sale. Just compare what you would pay for the item in a department store, and the dry cleaning cost will seem minimal. :) You will most likely need to press a garment after its journey through the mail. Please do not cancel your bid. We sellers appreciate it if you wait to bid until you are sure. Bidders who frivolously cancel truly jeopardize a seller's income and can scare other bidders away. Read everything carefully, and please stick with the bid if you bid. Be sure to look at the other auctions by Duckfeed. I have a lot of beautiful, quality clothing and vintage collectibles. Shipping/handling (by Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation, insurance extra and optional) charge for this item is $.

    <Description>This washed velvet "jeans" or western jacket by J. Jill is very soft, it is a great champagne color. Looks smashing with darker colors. Has two button-through chest pockets, button cuffs, collar, waist tabs. In good used condition, there are no stains or rips, and though the velvet is rubbed in a few tiny spots (comes with the territory in washed velvet), the jacket looks very good and is ready to play! The tag says size XL, but it fits more like a large-- this jacket would fit a size 12 (loose) to 14. Please go by the measurements: 48" bust, 24" length. From a smoke-free home. Shipping will be $5.70. We accept personal checks (with a hold for clearance), money orders and Billpoint. PLEASE NOTE THAT WE DO NOT ACCEPT PAYPAL. Payment must be received within ten days of auction's end. All sales final. Thank you for looking at this auction!</Description>

Made of 100% nylon, 15 denier, the stocking welt with it_s famous Pico (colored material at the top of the welt), RHT (reinforced heel and toe) and set flat knit which gives them the silkiest feeling that nylons can have._ This is new old stock in mint condition, which was purchased directly from Hanes, probably the last Hanes 415s to ever leave the factory, and the welt never received the writing transfer._ Barely Black _ These stockings are in the shade Barely Black that is an off Black Goes so well with outfits in the shades of _ Red, Green, Black, Yellow, Gray, Lavender, And Silver. _ These lovely Vintage nylon stockings will probably never be made again and as with all my vintage stockings I only have a limited amount to offer for sale.

    <Description>I purchased this unusual Hermes scarf for my mother and she has never used it. It is from about 5 or 6 years ago. It is a very large size 35" X 35". The hem is rolled and hand stitched. The pattern is one of the best pieces of artwork that I have ever seen from Hermes. It is different scenes of antique cars, clothes, and people going on fancy picnics. There is also pictured a number of kelly bags and birkin bags. It really is one of the nicest scarves I've seen. The photos show all the details. SMOKE FREE AND PET FREE HOME Please email me with questions. Buyer pays shipping. I accept Paypal and money orders. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>Copyright Disclosures Hi, most of you are probably not aware, but copying of a seller's original text or photo from an auction is an infringement on their copyright. The following are guidelines and rules disclosed by eBay: Contrary to popular belief, the fact that material is posted on the world wide web does not mean it is in the "public domain" or otherwise free to be taken, copied or used by others......... eBay Guideline: No copying allowed! When you prepare your auction listings you generally should use only material ( text , photographs , etc.) and trademarks/names that you created or own yourself or licensed from the owners. Here are some examples of potentially infringing auctions: You copy someone else's auction text and (without permission) paste it into your own auction to sell the same item (Making slight modifications to the text may not relieve you of liability if it is substantially similar to the original text). We do not authorize copying of any text or photos from our auctions. For more information on copyrights &amp; trademarks, please go to the "Help" section on eBay. Incredible Bridal Gown with 6-Layer Skirt ~ Size 16-20 This "BRAND NEW" (it was not a store sample and has never been tried on), bridal gown is so INCREDIBLE. The gown features a Queen Anne neckline trimmed with exposed lace edging. The form fitted bodice is adorned with exquisite cord lacing accented with sewn on pearl beading, sequins and seed beads. The illusion back features matching lace and beading, it closes with satin buttons that really button and a zipper at the bottom. The flattering basque waistline is draped with absolutely gorgeous lace and flows to beautiful tulle ballgown skirt accented with matching lace and beading. The skirt is trimmed at the hem with scalloped lace and flows to a stunning Cathedral train. This gown is fully lined with built in netting ~ an additional crinoline is recommended if a fuller skirt is desired (as shown in photos). ML69201356 The low reserve on this gown is not the "buy it now" price. It is just high enough to allow the "buy it now" option to be available for the first couple of days of the auction. Features: Color: White Fabric: Satin Top and Tulle Skirt Neckline: Queen Anne Sleeves: Short Ballgown with built in crinoline Train: Cathedral Approximate Measurements: (according to the mfg's sizing chart) Bridal Gown Size: 18 Bust: 41.5 Waist: 33 Hips: N/A Total Seam Allowance: 3" Bridal sizes do not correspond to your regular dress size, each manufacturer has it's own sizing chart. Please use the above measurements as guidelines to ensure proper fit. Most gowns have a 1" seam allowance on each side (total 2"), and can be easily altered to at least two sizes down or one size up. Please remember that wedding gowns are fitted garments and most need some alterations for proper fit. Please click here to see photos of my other eBay gowns!! About the Gowns: Brand New Gown ~ A "Brand New" gown is a gown that has never been displayed and never been tried on. It is in mint condition. A few loose treads or beads may be possible. New Gown ~ A "New" gown has never been altered or worn to a wedding. It was probably a store model and tried on a few times (much like the clothing we buy at department stores) . It may have a few loose beading, but do not appear to have any noticeable spots, makeup smudges, tears or rips (some minor blemishes from normal dressing room wear may be possible ~ like on the skirt hem) ~ it will not need to be dry-cleaned. Any noticeable spots or flaws will be mentioned in the description. It may also be a Production Sample ~ designers sometimes make different variations of the same gown prior to production. Therefore, Production Samples are Brand New gowns that are the 1st or 2nd cuts prior to production, sometimes used as a designer showroom sample (not tried on) or an original one of a kind! Photos: Due to amateur lighting and photography, the photos may not reflect the exact color of the gown. When applicable, please refer to the catalog (professional) photos for more accurate details. Steaming : Most gowns will need to be steamed before wearing as the gowns get creased and wrinkled from being packaged and during shipping. Steaming is usually done after alterations by the seamstress. Terms and Conditions: Serious Bidders Only Please!! ~ If you have any questions, please ask before bidding. Please place your bids accordingly ~ I get many after auction e-mails from heartbroken brides who thought they won the gown of their dreams. They find out during the last few seconds they were outbid and don_t have time to place another bid. Many auctions are won by experienced bidders who bid during the last 30 seconds of the auction. We apologize, but we only ship to the U.S. and Canada, so please don't bid and then ask me to ship overseas after the auction . Payment: "Buy it Now" ~ If you choose to close the auction using the "Buy it Now" option, you must be prepared to pay for the gown within 48 hours of the close of the auction. Payment for all others are due within 10 days . I glady accept payments by MasterCard , Visa and Money Order (I do not use Paypal or Billpoint). Due to the nature of bridal apparel ~ all sales are final. Shipping: I ship every Monday and Thursday . Buyer pays fixed shipping fee as follows: $15.00 for UPS Ground shipping in the U.S. (except for Alaska, Hawaii and Guam). $20.00 for USPS Priority Mail shipping to Guam . $25.00 for UPS Standard shipping to Canada. We apologize, but we do not ship to any other countries, so please don't bid . Buyer is responsible for any applicable Canadian taxes, sorry, but we cannot falsify our invoice. Alaska and Hawaii ~ rates vary depending on your zip code and available services ~ I'd be happy to give you a quote, just let me know your shipping zip code. $6.00 for UPS' COD service (that is the flat rate UPS charges). All shipping fees include insurance coverage up to the value of the final bid price of the gown (we do not charge extra to insure your gown). To ensure proper packaging and handling, payment must be received before noon the day prior to shipping (e.g., payment for Thursday's shipment must be received before noon on Wednesday). If you prefer a different shipping method, please let me know in advance so that I can advise you of the price and availability. UPS DOES NOT deliver to P.O. Box and APO addresses. Combined Shipping - I love repeat customers and offer 50% off U.S. shipping rate at $7.50 for each gown after the first. $12.00 for Alaska, Hawaii, Guam and Canada. There is not limit on the number of gowns, they just need to be shipped at the same time. All gowns have been protected and will be shipped in a brand new zippered bridal garment bag (valued at up to $15). Thanks for looking and good luck bidding! California residents please add 8% sales tax. Bid &amp; Buy with Confidence ~ We are eBay PowerSellers!

    <Description>Welcome To Avante Studios ! We are second-generation jewelers with over 45 years combined experience in fine gold, gemstone &amp; pearl jewelry....... In this listing we are offering another stunning Avante Studio original: 7.5mm Black Pearls with rich peacock overtones, combined with 4.5mm Pink Pearls. The luster of the pearls in this unique choker is Excellent (highly reflective), the color is Black with rich peacock overtones and Shell Pink, the surface quality is Excellent (lightly circled), and the Grade is AA. The nacre thickness of these pearls is better than 95%. Retail value $575.00. The necklace is choker length of 15.5" and is professionally handknotted on doubled silk, with a 14K filligree clasp.... Much prettier than the pictures, which don't adequately convey the beautiful colors. These are Cultured Freshwater Pearls from Lake Biwa, Japan. You can make no better choice in cultured freshwater pearls than those from Lake Biwa, due to unusual saltiness of the Lake that produces pearls closely comparable in hardness and quality to ocean pearls. Japanese pearls have long been celebrated as being the finest freshwater pearls available &amp; still hold that title today. Lake Biwa Pearls are being produced again, due to importation of Kasumigaura mussels and environmental improvements to the Lake. Biwa Pearls will maintain their beautiful luster and shape for a lifetime without fading, cracking, peeling or discoloring, which can happen to other pearls. We can offer such excellent prices on high quality jewelry because we buy direct, do all the work in our own studio and bring the item directly to you for a fraction of the retail cost. Accompanied by Certificate of Authenticity. Will arrive in a white gift box. Shipping is Priority Mail with confirmation tracking. RETURNS: you may return any item you are not completely satisifed with for a full refund within 7 days of receipt (minus shipping only). Paypal, Check or MO accepted. ( We are new to eBay, so please don't hold our low feedback against us...check the recent feedback we have--it is excellent !! ) Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>VINTAGE BAKELITE HANDLE PURSE A nice vintage piece of momen's wear. A black leather purse with a tan handle. I assume the handle to be bakelite but I am not an expert. There is minor damage where the handle pivots to open. It still functions fine but it is damaged. The exterior leather is fine. The interior fabric is worn. It has a clutch strap on back. I try to offer items that will be good additions to existing collections. Take a minute and check out my other auctions as there is something for everyone. All my auctions have a low opening bid and will go where they will go. Check them out. Remember Christmas is coming. If you buy two or more items I will package them to minimize the shipping cost.

    <Description>his is a fantastic khaki-colored, classic, button front poplin shirt from the GAP. It is from the GAP distribution center near my home and is NOT defective in any way. (Please see my rating and bid with confidence.) This is a great shirt in a GAP Maternity Extra Small. Shoulder to shoulder measures 15 1/2" and sleeve length is 23. This shirt falls to the hip (covers those tummy panels), has a button front and button cuffs. This would look equally as nice at the office as it would with a comfy pair of jeans! Thx for looking and have fun eBaying! :)</Description>

Shoulder to shoulder measures 17" and sleeve length is 25". This shirt falls to the hip (covers those tummy panels), has a button front and button cuffs.

    <Description>Sexy &amp; Unusual Black Silk and White Bugelbeads and sequins I can guarantee you won't meet someone else wearing the same dress. It is made of 100% silk and hand sewn glass bugelbeads and sequins. The detail is very unusual. It is also an unusual style. Shoulders are exposed and it is a mini or short dress. The back of the dress at the hem is in the shape of a deep V. It starts off 7" shorter on the side and dips down to the full 24" // It says large but go by the measurements because I think it is more of a medium. Shoulders: NA Bust: 38" Waist: 35" Hips: 38" Length from waist: 24" I accept money orders, bidpay and paypal No checks accepted. If you send one it will be returned to you.

Click here to see my other auctions TERMS: Payment must be received within 7 days of notification that you have won the auction. If payment is not received within 7 days of my contacting you, I will request a fee credit from eBay, relist the item for sale and leave you negative feedback. Please do not bid if you do not intend to pay for the auction. Postive feedback will be left for you upon receipt of payment. Your package will be shipped in the first shipment to go out after payment is received. I generally ship 2-3 times per week. All packages are shipped priority mail unless otherwise noted in the auction. I accept PayPal, Billpoint, Bidpay, money orders and cash payments. Foreign money orders must be in US currency.

If you would like protection from damage during shipping you have the option to purchase insurance on your package. The cost of insurance is $1.10 for items $50.00. For items valued between $51.00 and $100.00, the cost of insurance is $2.00. If you do not insure your package, I cannot and will not be responsible for damage or loss during shipping. FEEDBACK: I have recently received a few negative feedbacks from newer users for situations out of my control. Although this should be clear from eBay's guidelines, I want to clarify the purpose of feedback. Positive feedback should be left if idividual has completed his/her side of the transaction. Your positive feedback will be left upon prompt payment. Negative feedback is meant to warn other ebayers of fraudulent sellers/deadbeat bidders. Neative feedback should be left if an item is paid for but never delivered to you or is misrepresented in the auction and the seller will not work with you to resolve the problem...Negative feedback should not be left because a workout video is harder than you anticipated, not because you thought the actors were horrible, not because the cinematography is poor quality in your opinion, and not because and error was made but then corrected at no expense to you (after all everyone makes mistakes, but a good seller will resolve the problem). I just felt I needed to clarify this after recent feedback for issues totally out of my control. I have worked very hard to earn the 2000+ feedback and will continue to do so.

    <Description>_ _ Ladies "Zig-Zag" Leather Jacket with Belt Georgetown Leather Design Wash. D.C. _ Size is marked as "5/6" 100% Leather Shell These measurements are provided so that someone can compare them to a jacket of their own. _ Width __ (shoulder to shoulder) = 15.5 inches _ Length __ (from back collar to bottom of jacket) = 28 inches Sleeves (from shoulder seam to cuff of sleeve) = 25.5 inches _ This leather jacket is pre-worn and it's really in great condition, way better than these fotos would suggest, the leather itself is very smooth yet fully flexible with very few, if any, natural blemishes._ There are two hand pockets on the lower front (one on each side) both are fully intact (no holes in pockets), the interior is a material lining and it is fully intact (no rips or tears), the "zig-zag" pattern on the front and the stripes on the sleeve are leather and sewn on, the belt is removeable, it has no buckle and is meant to be tied, the only thing "wrong" with this jacket is that the bottom of the cuffs have the absolute minimalist of "wear" on them, this jacket is really in great condition and a quick wipe down with a damp cloth will make it look practically brand new, the color of this jacket is slightly darker than it appears in these fotos (my camera isn't the best). I never wore this particular jacket but just found it, bought it and put it in a closet. _ This is gonna sound crazy but it's the truth - A couple of years ago I thought it would be a good idea to buy enough leather items to constitute a small herd of cows and then sell these leather goods on eBay, thus "saving" a small herd of living cows from being killed so their hides could be used for items like this, I know that this won't really happen (no matter how much I would like it to) and that animals are killed everyday regardless of my small effort but since I don't personally like the idea of killing animals (for any reason) I thought that recycling already manufactured leather goods was better than doing nothing at all, I said that was gonna sound crazy and maybe it is, but I don't care, most people think I'm nuts anyways._ I have nothing against anyone who would like to own this item, I only bought things that were in really good shape and that I found to be functionable and fashionable so I'm more than happy to try and find someone to help me out in this somewhat bizzare recycling project._ The bottom line is that I just think it's a better thing for us to make use of what we already have! These digital images aren't always of the highest colour quality or detail and this jacket will always look way better in-person. If the images above aren't showing up, try "clicking" on them and selecting the "view image" option. TERMS FOR TRADE PLEASE DO NOT BID ON THIS AUCTION IF YOU CAN'T MEET THESE TERMS FOR TRADE! I put this information up here so people can fully understand what they need to do in order to successfully complete this auction._ I'm 100% serious about all of this and I'd simply rather not waste my time and resources with any people who aren't, fair enough? PAYMENT Payment is due within 10 days of my sending the end of auction notification e-mail and by any one of these following methods. _ 1. U.S. Postal Order or Money Order (Canadian M.O.'s are OK too._ International bidders - We have to see what we can work out). _ 2. Verified Cashiers' Check (please note that this is drawn from a Bank and not a Personal Check). _ 3. Cleverly concealed currency, as long as it's well secured with tape and wrapped in paper or between card. _ 4. Through eBay Payments._ eBay Payments isn't really an "instant payment method" as it takes them approximately ____ 2-3 DAYS before they actually transfer those funds to my account and only at that point can I ship out an item. SHIPPING Within the Continental United States This item can be shipped by either method "A", "B" or "C"._ Closing Bidders must choose which method they prefer. The cost of shipping this item is going to depend on two things, the weight of the wrapped package and it's ZIP Code destination, my policy on shipping is that you pay what it costs to ship something and not a penny more. That said, these rates shown are for a package that weighs 1lb. or under, this item most likely weighs more than 1lb so these rates are just an example of the three different kinds of shipping that I offer, once a package's destination is known I can send you an accurate cost of shipping. A. Priority Mail - at it's basic flat rate, this is sent "no frills" via the USPS, with an est. 2 day delivery time = $3.50 B. Priority Mail - with Delivery Confirmation (this is not Insured), via the USPS, with an est. 2 day delivery time = $3.90 C. Priority Mail - with Postal Insurance, via the USPS, with an est. 2 day delivery time (this method is recommended) = $4.60 Outside the Continental United States International shipping costs are determined by the package's actual weight and it's final destination, these closing bidders will be e-mailed an accurate cost of shipping once the package's destination is known._ Overseas delivery times range from 4 to 10 days. ONCE THIS AUCTION HAS CLOSED I'll e-mail the closing bidder (usually within 24 hours), ask which method of payment and shipping they prefer and request the : Name , Mailing Address , Zip Code and/or Country that this package will be sent to._ Payment is due within 10 days of this e-mail notification and as stated by these terms of trade._ As a seller, my policy is to ship all items within 24 hours of their payment being received as well as keeping in contact with the bidder from the close of an auction to the receipt of merchandise._ My feedback policy on completed transactions is - "If you want some, leave some, because if you don't, I won't." ._ That might sound "wrong", but it has proven itself to work without a hitch considering I had been burned on feedback 200+ times before I adopted this approach and never since after._ Most eBayer's have been great about meeting these terms for trade and to them I give my thanks! _ I've been collecting music (records, tapes, cds, videos) as well as the artwork/text around and about it (tour programs, books, magazines, t-shirts, posters, patches, pins, flyers, etc.) for decades._ I've ended up with tons of stuff I don't have the room to continue storing and since it's not doing me any good just sitting here I've decided to pass it all along to others via eBay with the simple hope that someone "out there" can find something they've been looking for (or even better, didn't yet know existed) at a price that they think is reasonable along with service that is exceptional._ Check out my feedback to see how well past eBayer's think I've done so far. stukinflorida is addicted to vinyl, a devoted t-shirtologist and enjoys long walks on short piers. PLEASE NOTE If life is a bowl of cherries then deadbeat bidders are the pits!_ If a closing bidder fails to meet any of these terms for trade I'll simply void the auction, relist the item and promptly leave those fraudulent bidders the negative feedback they've justly earned._ Questions about this item or about these terms for trade?_ Send them my way and they'll be answered to the best of my ability._ Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>This auction is for a brand new white express tube top. It zips up on the side and ties on the top. The tag says Express stretch, so the material does stretch. Although it is new, the plastic tag is still on, but the actual tag is not. I have a habit of ripping off tags before making sure I fit in the item! Email me with questions. Winning bidder pays s/h. Good luck and check out my other auctions! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information. Payment Instructions I leave the shipping cost up to the highest bidder (either standard or priority mail) which is determined once auction is over and have had communication with the highest bidder.</Description>

    <Description>This auction is for a COACH bag from my pile of purses. Since I am a stay at home Mom now, I seem to have a diaperbag in place of a purse. This bag received very little use. It looks like new with the exception of some mild darkening on the side that would rub agains your clothes or body. There is also one small ink pen mark about 1/2" long on the back. Neither showed very well in a picture. The strap is adjustable with 4 setting and buckles on each side. The strap is 2" wide for comfort. The leather COACH tag is still a part of this purse and the inside is simple. 2 equal sized compartments. The bag closes with a flap. No snap or magnetic closure and there is no small zipper compartment inside. It measures 13" across, 10" tall and is 3" wide at the bottom. Bidding starts at $39.99 Winner pays $5.20 shipping. Money order, preferred. Questions? Contact me at ARCOTAZ@aol.com Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>________ * TITLE BURBERRY Authentic BURBERRY Grayish-green plaid lambswool scarf for winter 2001, 2002 (Express-recorded mail is option for Christmas gift. Only 3~5 days to delivery to US ) (It can be nice event for receiver gets this scarf for Christmas gift from outside US via express mail pack. I will write winner's name on package) This is 100% Authentic BURBERRY grayish-green plaid lambswool scarf made in England. BURBERRY CATALOG : LW / 19 ( rare longest products : Measured 70" length x 12" wide x 3" fringe) You are bidding brand New condition(unused, unopend) comes with tag, original plastic bag, barcode. (Authentic BURBERRY Greyish Green, Navy Blue, Nova, gray color lambswool scarf is available to only winners until all is sold out. Keep one or two color scarfs, and wear best color scarf to suit your dress. Some seller is selling many many only one color scarf in eBay...it is very strange) LW / 17 LW / 14 LW / 25 LW / 112 * HOW TO DISTINGUISH 100% auth BURBERRY 2001,2002 PRODUCTS CAUTION : Check what is original BURBERRY 2001 products. See my current feedbacks from winners on my previous Burberry scarf auctions. Many user is asking me about the way to distinguish authentic BURBERRY. Here it is. ***** BURBERRY is one of very famous and popular brand as luxury goods. So, many cloth producer made fake of it. Then, to protect brand name from those goods, BURBERRY is doing following on 2001, 2002 products. Buyers must to know what is original BURBERRY. *****First, Check BURBERRY logo on hard-paper tag and label on the goods. If the log is like this 'Burberry', it is old products, so it can have much possible to be fake goods. Now all 2001,2002 BURBERRY products log is like this "BURBERRY". *****Second, Check BURBERRY special tag . BURBERRY 2001, 2002 products is changing with special tag, especially all lambswool scarfs. When you touch the horse mark, it will disappear shortly and show up again. If you make a ligher fire approach to the horse mark for 3~4 seconds, the mark will disappear clearly. Then after 10 seconds, it will show up again. But still some cashmere products is still using tag w/ blue button. On this case, you have to check the logo "BURBERRY". ***** *****Third, Check label's position on the scarf. For example, if it is auth BURBERRY lambswool or cashmere scarf, the label's position is middle of first plaid exactly. Compare lable's position in below picture. authentic BURBERRY label on scarf is located middle of check * WHAT IS BEST WAY TO BUY auth 100% BURBERRY The Best way is to buy in offical BURBERRY shop or to find belivable store or dealer in your local area. When you buy some BURBERRY goods in internet like eBay, you must check above three way before you buy. I hope BURBERRY lovers don't get many fake and imitation BURBERRY goods w/ much money in eBay and local market. I only carry authentic BURBERRY goods and 100% guarantee. Rare BURBERRY longest( 70"length...not 50" ) cashmere scarf is in stock (light gray, nova and classic color) Our special dealer price is only $200 now. Check retail price in your near stores.

    <Description>This cream is a full size jar of the cream. It is a wonderful lemon frag smells so good you will want to eat it! :-) This is an actual makeup remover it literally melts the makeup off your face! Leave on for 10 seconds and just tissue off. This is a wonderful way to remove your makeup cause you do not tug and pull on the delicate tissues of the skin (which is much better for your skin). Buyer is to pay 3.95 shipping and insurance is recommended. I will combine items to save on shipping so be sure to view my other items more coming soon.

You heard right...CASHMERE!!! Hugo Boss just never stops! He has brought you a coat worthy of royalty and ONLY WORN ONCE. The feeling of this coat... It's absolutely amazing! The material of this jacket is so impressive that it'll make you want to wear it all the time. Made by Hugo Boss of Italy, this hand - stitched specimen of quality leaves nothing to be criticised. It's a coat that's right off the rack of the finest suits ANYONE could offer! Wha t I really love about this coat is that is would be appropriate for just about ANY OCCASSION because it's color and pattern are conservative, yet sharp, and the texture of the fabric would work either in the office or out at Sunday brunch. With it's overall cool dark blue/ash - gray color, relaxed cut and form, notched lapels, single-vented back, slightly - padded square shoulders, chest and flap pockets, this garment just oozes with class...something only those with high appreciation for fine clothing should wear. Hugo Boss has long been known to be of the world's leaders when it comes to setting fashion trends, especially in the business and formal arenas. This suit represents the 'power/ wealth image' with it's crisp cut and sharp, yet comfortable edges. Hugo Boss is the unique combination of class, style and youth that portrays the image of one in command, in style and on the edge... where you've gotta be! Designed for the highest comfort level possible, this coat further displays it's quality and durability in the integration of grey and white swirling buffalo horn buttons, along with it's hand-stitched,silky-smooth lining. In fact THE ENTIRE GARMENT IS HAND - STITCHED IN SILK!!! With such detail paid to ensuring a suit's lifespan and aesthetic appeal, it shouldn't surprise you that the retail value of a similar coat could easily be $1200.00, but now you can get this piece for a small fraction of it's original price.

    <Description>Pashmina, from the Persian word for wool, is one of the greatest treasures ever to come out of the Himalayan kingdoms; it is one of the richest, rarest fibers in the world. Once known as "the fiber of the gods", it is possibly the softest, lightest and warmest wool nature has produced, and unlike any other wool, it actually gets softer with every time you wear it! Pashmina wool is part of the cashmere family, but it is even finer. It is shorn from the undercoat of the Himalayan mountain goat (Capri hircus) which is indigenous to the remotest regions of Tibet Plateau and Central Asia. Shawls and blankets have been woven from pashmina wool for over a thousand years, prized by kings, queens and common people alike for its warmth and long life. In fact, so treasured was pashmina, that maharajas, Kashmiris and the Tibetan Lords, kept it hidden from the western world until the late 18th century, instead trading in cashmere with its "rougher" fibers 80%pashmina 20% silk ,210 count 2 ply ,36x80 SIZE genuine pashmina direct form nepal quality gruantee . $8 shipping /handling in usa .

    <Description>This is a beautiful short sleeved top by Meg Lauren purchased from Mothertime for $28.00. It is a pale creamy yellow made from 100% cotton. The button down flaps at each side lift up to reveal 2 vertical slits for discreet nursing. It is very roomy and soft. Certain to make a woman feel more comfortable during those last few months of pregnancy! The tags are still attached and would make a great gift! Shipping is $3.95 and I accept Paypal &amp; Money orders only. Thanks!</Description>
