    <Description>We wish all of you a very happy and safe Christmas and New Years, and in light of all the tragic events that have occured, let us still be thankful and happy for all that we have, our family, friends, our country and our terrific freeway of life. We are here, live for TODAY and ENJOY- MERRY XMAS and HAPPY NEW YEAR TO YOU ALL and a HUGE thanks to all our customers!! Welcome To Our Auctions by Canadianas, Bookmark us and check back weekly, we always get new and some really neat things, FOR TIPS ON HOW TO KEEP AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR FURS AND LEATHERS SEE THIS IN ABOUT ME! ALL FURS ARE REAL unless otherwise stated. Ebay has now added a new feature to block deadbeat buyers from bidding on sellers items - you guessed it - you bid and don't pay, you are on this list from here on in :-(( Sorry!! PLEASE DO NOT ASK US TO STOP ANY OF OUR AUCTIONS! Our Stock #V70. Shipping via air mail to Canada and U.S. only on this item including handling and insurance would be $20.00. Model is 5'3", 120 pounds, shoulders 16", hips 38" a with size range of 8-10. Measurements and Particulars Item Type and Colour - This is a ladies petite coyote longer fur coat. Shoulders across top - 16" this is a very important measurement! Chest by tape measure - 34" Waist - 30" Hips -36" Arms measured from top of shoulder to where the coat arm ends at cuff - 22" Length - 43" Sweep - 54" Designer - No label Age of Item - Unknown Size on tag or estimated here only, but PLEASE go by our measurements 2-7 Front Detail - Hooks up front, pockets on sides. Condition Detail - Fur supple, minor finger wear pocket edge. Stress areas around the arm have been checked, no rips or tears. Our Rating - 8 Lining - Taupe condition good. Please Read Our Conditions and Instructions below the photos. All items are USED unless otherwise stated, and measured on outside with items done up. The rating does not reflect age but condition only, as is visible to us. Coats may or may not be vintage as we have no way of knowing their age. A rating of 10 is LIKE NEW or NEW and we usually only rate a 10 on new items. A 9 is in good condition with no mentionable signs of wear that we feel is obvious, but keeping in mind these are used coats. An 8 is showing signs of wear that we could find on FUR or LINING as described but still in good condition, or that we consider it vintage. A 7 is wear is obvious in mentioned areas but still very wearable. Anything 6 and under we list as crafts, you can determine from write-up whether you can fix it or use it to remake other items. All furs may or may not have a monogram . If this is a concern please ask before auction is over, we can REMOVE THEM for an extra $25.00, just let us know if you would like this option, however we do not do monogramming, you would have to have this done. All furs will have been repaired if required, or damage as described in writeup. It is up to YOU to know what type of fur you are bidding on, as each one has its own qualities and textures. I am a non smoker and to the best of my ability try to detect odours on the furs we purchase, we will not buy ones that I can detect a smell, other than the fur smell itself. If you find your coat has an odour, an airing for a couple of hours outside, generally works well to freshen it up, but if you have a super sensitive sniffer :-) best buy new! If you are buying a fur for a present and are uncertain about measurements, it is a good idea to get a coat that fits the person you are buying for, lie the coat flat on the ground, done up, and take a tape measure and measure, underarm to underarm for chest, shoulder seam to wrist for arms, etc. etc. Hope this helps! As you can see by our positives, we have a high level of customer satisfaction. . Item "as is", "all sales are final-no refunds". We are not responsible for lost or stolen items from the mail! For Your Convenience Payments Are Now Simple With Bid Pay and Billpoint - Pay via any major credit card or on-line money order, as we have now registered with them both, or a direct wire transfer to our bank if you are not in an INTERNATIONAL area that accepts Billpoint. WE DO NOT ACCEPT PAYPAL. Click image to view larger version Click image to view larger version If you are an international bidder, living outside of Canada and the U.S., we would have to advise you of the shipping depending on where you live and if we ship to that area, and would ask that if you are the highest bidder payment be made through Bidpay or Billpoint only.

Many designers measure clothes differently, so we will show the size if there is one, plus the measurements we have taken, so Please ask ALL your questions while the auction is on, we will reply to them all unless we are having a server problem or we do not get them . If there is something you do not understand or are unclear of, please ask, as misunderstandings result in negatives, which is unfair to us, and to you. See our feedbacks and bid with confidence.

    <Description>tux# 110 #110--- This Black Tail tuxedo was "UNION MADE IN THE USA" by Christian Dior. This tuxedo originally cost $450!! This is a quality wool tuxedo not polyester like some that are sold on ebay.

The pants have a satin stripe. This is a 2pc tuxedo. The shirt, vest, cummerbund, and tie are not included as I'm out of those items. This one is dry clean only. It came from my tuxedo rental business and is in very nice condition. Have you checked the price of renting a Tuxedo lately??? This tuxedo rents for over $100 in most rental stores and that's for just one night!! . Why rent when you can own for less$$$??? Check out the other Tuxedos I have on eBay to save on shipping.

These luminescent pearls are just the softest pink imaginable - a shade usually only saved for baby blankets, bunny's noses and the velvet petals of your first rose. Their shimmering pastel tones glow against the skin, picking up warm flashes of peach and the cooler tones of lilac, depending on the light. These lovely pearls measure about 5 mm each and are of the somewhat rounded shape of natural freshwater pearls.

Tekno knows how long it has been since you_ve fed him and he_s quick to remind you when he_s in need of some playtime. Tekno is programmed to respond just like any 8-week-old puppy. His state-of-the-art sensors allow him to see and hear everything around him, including you and your own voice. Tekno_s sensors also enable his powerful computer brain to know when it_s getting dark, if your house lights suddenly turn on or if a friend is knocking on your door. The puppy comes with what you see in the picture plus the instruction manual and batteries are included. The box has long been thrown out, but Tekno was kept in new in-box condition!

The clothing I sell will be 95% from smoke free homes, and washed and pressed for you and inspected for stains and rips so none will be sold as much as can be helped. I will also offer a money back deal for you if you are not satisfied with your purchase. Just return it and I will send your money back. I will ship on Saturday Mornings and will ship mostly U.S. Postal 2-3 day mail since most clothing weighs to much to send any other mail class.

If I were to overlook something , and you need to return the item, then I will refund your final price of the auction, not the postage. Most things, I do not make enough on to refund shipping also! Sorry! All auctions are sent next day with Money Order or PayPal and in 10 days for checks, with less than 50 positive feedbacks. I ship priority, and I will email you right after the auction ends to let you know your actual priority charge....I charge for actual shipping, never any hidden charges!!!! If the item is bigger or there is a more than one piece then it might be a little higher, depending on the weight. Bigger items, such as furniture and such, I will take to the PO after I get your mailing address and see what the charge will be, and that is what you will pay, I don't charge a handling fee at all!!!!

    <Description>You are bidding on a lot of two suits by MT Studio made especially for Macy's. They are both the same style suit. One is a gorgeous terracotta/clay color (it is deeper clay colored than the photo shows), the other suit is solid black. The jackets are lined but the pants are not. Pants have a side button and zipper closure. The jackets (36 bust, 36 hip, 16 1/4 sleeve inseam to wrist) and pants (40 hip, 28 waist, 29 inseam) are all size 10 PETITE. What a deal for two nice suits! Dry clean only. (I cant seem to get a photo of the black suit on here, but it is exactly like the one pictured.) All items come from a smoke free home. Bidding Terms: I strive to give an as accurate description as I possibly can, therefore, my items are sold "as is" with no refunds. Winning bidder prepays the high bid plus shipping. US bidders have choice of Priority Mail or Parcel Post. International winning bidder will need to send address so that actual shipping cost can be determined. Insurance is optional. I assume no responsibility for items lost or damaged in shipment if not insured. Please respond to email within 3 days. I accept Pay Pal, money orders or cashiers checks within 10 days of end of auction. I am sorry, but I cannot accept personal or business checks at this time.

    <Description>* * Yes, I ship internationally!! * * *Another picture below* Hanna Andersson Corduroys Size 110 This auction is for two pairs of Hanna Andersson corduroy pants. They are not new, but still look great. They have slight fading from washing and the knees are just lightly faded. (The light from the flash has made them look more faded than they really are. Please trust me, you will be satisfied with these pants!) One pair is navy blue and the other pair is black and they both have black/white gingham inside the waistbands. These are great pants to wear in the winter as they are warm! They are size 110 and here is a link to the Hanna Andersson sizing chart if you need it. * Shipping * $4.00 QUESTIONS?

    <Description>You are bidding on a festive sweater from Baby Gap. This hand-made garment is very high quality, and boy, is it cute too! The heathered charcoal knit has two puppy dogs on the front; a basset hound and a terrier in a plaid doggie coat. The original price was $48. The size is large, which fits infants approximately 12-18 months old. The material is a wool blend (82% acrylic/18% wool). This sweater has never been worn, and is packaged in the original plastic shipping bag (since gap.com doesn't tag the items, these are the equivalent of nwt). Please check my other auctions for this sweater in several other sizes, so siblings can match for holiday photos and parties! Please email me with any questions before you bid, as all sales are final. This item is from a smoke-free household. The winning bidder is to pay the bid amount, plus 3.50 Priority shipping (international rates will be quoted.) Insurance is $1.10 extra, and please consider insurance if you are concerned about loss or damage, as I have no control over an item once it has been shipped.

Your payment for an item is due within 10 days of the auction end. I will combine shipping for the best value if you win 2 or more things. Thanks for your interest. Good luck and happy bidding!

We consolidate shipments from our international offices to give you the lowest international shipping rates available . "My name is I Made Suadi and was born in Bali on December 31, 1952. My hobby is creating new designs of clothing. I have been learning how to make clothes since 1975; even though I am a man and at that time most of the designers were women, that didn't stop me from learning and observing the fashion. That is why, then, I took the course of making clothes. "My works are inspired by Balinese art and culture. Many tourists come to Bali to see and get to know more about Balinese art and culture. When they go back to their countries, of course they will bring something as presents to their families and friends. Then I create some clothes, which can be a present as well as a useful gift. "In making clothes I use batik cotton textiles. I have researched these media to learn whether they contain toxins or not. The result is they are non-toxic. It is best to wash the clothes by hand (cool water) or machine wash (40__c) and avoid drying in direct sunshine. "NOVICA is one way for young and small artists to promote their art works into the whole world. The important thing is that through NOVICA we can promote Indonesian art and culture, especially Balinese." Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Visit NOVICA.com today!

    <Description>this is the hottest jacket! they don't make jackets like this one anymore! worn but still in great condition - the lining has a lot of tears and needs to be repaired. the leather is so beautiful - heavy too! zips up the front, has a zipper for a zip in lining but I don't have the lining, elastic ribbed waist &amp; cuffs, snap shut pockets. just examine the photos - this is a great find! size 42 and measures: shoulders 19.5", sleeves 26", length 26", chest 24.5" across the front. truly a fantastic jacket!</Description>

    <Description>You are bidding on the most fabulous pair of BRAND NEW, with tags-authentic BEBE 5 pocket, button fly jeans with denim flowers sewn around the front pocket(s) and at the bottom of each tapered frayed edge pant leg-size 27 or 4. Imagine these fabulous jeans with a plain black turtleneck or sweater and a pair of boots! Cute and classy! The jeans have a low rise fit that's why the waist is approximately 29 in, a 32" inseam, and slightly flared leg bottoms. These pants originally retailed for $149.00 plus tax in Bebe stores-just weeks ago! These are definitely a must have. The photos below came from the Bebe website just about a month ago! I also have these same jeans in a size 25, 26, 29,30 Check out my other auctions for more AUTHENTIC Designer STUFF in a bunch of styles, sizes and colors! If you don't see what you like feel free to email me-I may not have had a chance to list it yet! I accept Paypal, Billpoint, cashiers checks and money orders. Buyer to pay $6 add $1.10 for insured shipping or instant Billpoint. I will ship international, but there will be a $5 s/h fee-on top of the actual shipping charges to your country.Most of my shipments are done on Saturdays. All sales are final.</Description>

Designed to elevate the body's ability to naturally increase the output of HGH (Human Growth Hormone) by the pituitary gland, Longevity 4's natural amino acids elevate the output of HGH by the pituitary gland.

Clinical Study Clinical Study : Longevity 4 (L-4) Conducted by Dr. Essman, Endocrinologist Date started on treatment: August 1, 1999 Date finished treatment: October 1, 1999 After 30 years of aging, levels of human growth hormone substantially decrease. Low levels of human growth hormone are directly associated with the many diseases associated with the aging process. Raised levels of HGH have produced health improvements and benefits. Dietary supplements composed of amino acids have been shown to promote the secretion of human growth hormone release. Pepsin has been shown to increase the amplitude and frequency of high release, in addition to amino acids. Argintine has been shown to diminish the effects of somatistatin, which is produced by the pituitary gland and inhibits human growth hormone from being distributed. Human growth hormone immediately changes into IGF-1 as we sleep. Increased IGF-1 levels indicate that human growth hormone have raised correspondingly.</Description>

    <Description>This auction is for a brand new pair of Reebok DMX Furys in a size 10. They are the remakes of the old fury instapumps. They have the pumps and instead of hexalite now they have DMX. I have a pair for myself and they are awesome. I bought 2 pairs, but realized that the ones I wear now will last for a long time, so I am auctioning off the other new pair. The buy it now price is well below what I paid for the shoes, so buy now! Shipping will be 12 dollars and that will come with insurance. Check out my other auctions :) Happy bidding.

Money Back Guarantee if not 100% Satisfied! Slot Machine Secrets Section: Just What Are Loose Slot Machines? Not all slot machines are created equal. In the early days, slot machines were totally unpredictable. Each spin of the three reels was independent of other spins, making their stops completely random. There was no "program" to cause the reels to stop on winning combinations a pre-set number of times. Today's machines are programmed. Each casino must pay out a percentage of what ever they take in each and every day. On average, Slot Machines will pay out as winnings 80% to as high as 98% of all coins that were dropped into the machines. Loose machines are ones which pay back a higher percentage of what they take in. Not All Slot Machines Are Created Equal! In the same casino, you will have one slot machine that pays out 80% right next to a machine that pays out 98%, in fact casinos usually will do this for various reasons. Now which machine would you like to play!?! Loose slot machines are the ones that pay out a higher percentage of what they take in. These are the machines you want to play. Our Book "Not All Slot Machines Are Created Equal" will explain how casinos decide which machines to program as loose machines. These loose machines can actually pay out more coins in a days time then they take in. Loose machines must do this to make up for the very tight machine. Once you locate a loose machine just sit back and enjoy! This insider Slot Machines Secrets will help you in locating loose slot machines within any casino in less than 5 minutes! NOW INCLUDED! With each Slot Machine Secrets package we now include "The Best Of The Slots" . After doing extensive travel to both Atlantic City &amp; Nevada we've compiled a chart which ranks 17 different casinos in terms of payouts! We have also evaluated the payout of $0.05, $0.25, $0.50, $1.00 and $5.00 machines. Now you will KNOW what machines to go to and which Casinos to PLAY IN! Blackjack Secrets Section: BlackJack Is One Of The Most Popular Games At The Casinos! Blackjack is a very popular game because its the only game in which the odds of winning are really under YOUR control. That's right, by following a few simple rules you can have the odds swing YOUR way! Our chapter on "BlackJack Secrets" will show you how! BlackJack is the only Casino game which YOU have a direct outcome of the game. Our package will show you when its best to bet greater amounts or lessor amounts of money. Our package starts you off with the basic rules of the game, written in a simple easy to understand language which a novice player will understand. Next you progress to a system of play in which the Casino no longer has any advantage over you! Finally you'll learn a system which DOES give YOU an advantage over the Casino. Many people have heard of Blackjack card counting, however not many people know how it works. The second part of our two part system follows some basic principles of card counting. However our system doesn't require any more math skills then the ability of adding 1 or subtracting 1! If you can add 1+1 you've got all the skills needed! You do not need the superior math and memorization skills needed for "true" card counting systems! However our method still give you a true advantage over the Casino! Extra Bonus Systems: Roulette Systems for Profit, and Basic Craps System For Maximum Fun! Roulette is an old Casino game, in fact one of the oldest of the table games. Its a very simple game to play, however without any strategy it can be very profitable for the Casinos! Our package will teach you several different strategies to play which will make Roulette less profitable for the Casinos and more fun &amp; profitable for YOU . Craps is the Casinos most exciting game to play! Just walk into any Casino and you'll ALWAYS see the most excited people and the most noise coming from the Craps tables! However this game can be complex for the beginner to understand. Craps is a game with so many different bets it can be very confusing for the beginner. Some of these bets can actually give the Casino nearly a 17% advantage over you the player. Our book removes the confusion and tells you what the best bets are and how to take the fullest advantage of these nearly wiping out the Casino's advantage and putting chips into your pocket! Advantages of our System verses Other Systems! You do not need to trend slot machines! You do not need to watch other people play for hours!

Don't Need PhotoGraphic Memory to Play BlackJack! No Need to Memorize Complex Formulas to Play Roulette! Written in Easy to Understand Language a Beginner can Understand! Money Back Guarantee if not 100% Satisfied! Recent Comments I've Received from Our Customers! Dear George, I went to the casino Saturday and won and then I went back on Sunday and won again! The feeling of AT LAST leaving the casino as a winner is just a great feeling that I have been waiting for. I lived 8 years in Monte Carlo, Monaco and I was always loosing and now I know why thanks to your Slot Machine Secrets! Now I follow the advices step by step and it was such a pleasure to do this calmly, watching and then start to play. What Slot Machine Secrets advises you NOT to do was exactly what I observed with other players doing and they were LOOSING! When I started playing I WON immediately for the first time on the slot machines! Incredible Item! Kindest Regards, Robert Hervieu Just one day after Robert wrote me the above letter, he wrote me the following: Dear George, I DID IT AGAIN. I hit the JACKPOT on the Slot Machines. Will now take it easy for a while. Thank you again. Kindest Regards Robert Hervieu Dear George, I just wanted you to know that I took your advice in the book to heart about not sticking with one machine because it's due to pay off any moment when it hasn't been paying off very much or at all. Instead, I stayed with the machine you suggested and that machine paid off just before going to bed and 4 more times the next day. I kept going back to it and you were right about loose machines paying frequently! I even when to the machine after a woman hit an even bigger jackpot on it than I had and she walked away immediately. Within a few minutes, I hit another smaller but substantial jackpot to keep me going. I actually left Lake Tahoe with a few hundred dollars more than I arrived with. That has NEVER happened before! Thank you again for sharing your secrets! Very truly yours, Marlane Testimonials Copyright _ 2000 G. W. Fetter Hi, I'm George Fetter, the author of "Slot Machine Secrets". I've been playing Slot Machines for over 10 years. I've also been a computer programmer, software engineer and systems designer working on many "Real-Time" Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems which is what Casinos use to control Slot Machine payouts. These payouts are regulated by the Gaming Commission and every Casino must keep very tight control on their payout percentages or risk losing their Gaming License! To maintain this tight of a control, SCADA systems have been used in nearly every Casino in the world. "Slot Machine Secrets" will reveal how you can in only a few minutes, detect which Slot Machines to Play and which to walk away from.

    <Description>STUNNING CIVIL WAR VICTORIAN WEDDING BALL DRESS GOWN You will be a vision of BEAUTY &amp; Old World ELEGANCE in this MOST romantic gown in it_s original creation by _Velvet Rose Design_! After an OVERWHELMING response, I decided to offer this vision of lovliness again! I would like to introduce myself... My name is Shauena, &amp; I am the Designer for _Velvet Rose Design_,Custom Creations are my forte... Each &amp; every gown starts as a dream in my head (or yours)... and all are lovingly made, with romantic vision and a desire to create your fantasy, dream come true...! A bride will feel Magical &amp; Radiant on her Special day, in this Dream Gown! I can accommodate any brides wishes! A gown comparable to this one (if you can even find it!) retails for upwards of $5000.00! If you do not find your size, please e-mail me and I will direct you to the auction that has your size! This gown has a pale pink bodice with little embroidered baby rose buds over organza...Can be worn off the shoulder or on... More &amp; more, brides are no longer choosing ALL white gowns for their special day! ALL white is a difficult color to wear for many, &amp; nothing warms MOST skin tones more than flattering pale pink! Main fabric of gown is BREATHTAKING white moire with a pale pink silk under skirt, which is surrounded by Venetian lace! The bodice is fitted &amp; completely boned &amp; lined with muslin... A draped, low ROMANTIC neckline frames the decollate which is ruched &amp; embellished with MORE silk flowers white &amp; pale pink baby rose buds &amp; ostrich plumes! White pearls &amp; silver bugle beads &amp; INCREDIBLE lace trim dangle from front of bodice! The same pearls &amp; bugle beads are along edge of skirt, edges of sleeves, bottom edge of bodice &amp; ends of bow ties at sleeves, as well as the entire edge of the VERY Victorian, "butterfly" bustled train! Train hooks to back of skirt, and bodice with 3 hooks &amp; eyes, and is detachable for dancing, or if you would like to wear it as a BEAUTIFUL Ball Gown to that reenactment event! This is a gown you can be married in and then wear to be the Belle of the Ball! A gown worthy of being cherished as an heirloom, to give to your daughter or grandaughter one day! Skirt is ruched at 3 graduating points in front &amp; embellished with white &amp; pale pink baby rose buds, and lace &amp; pale pink ostrich plumes! The bodice measures 36-38__, waist is 32_, but it is a variable since the back closure is grommeted &amp; can be pulled tighter or looser as does a corset, for a lovely fit! Length of skirt is 47_ from waist band to edge of skirt...circumference of skirt is 140_ &amp; fits over a hoop of the same measure or slightly bigger! Bell of sleeve drops lower in back for that very HIGH styled look! The train is 198_ around and the bustle is pleated on sides &amp; center giving it a very draped &amp; flowing elegant fall! There is over 20 yards of fabric in this gown, so there is a lot of weight to it ! The hoop skirt underneath is not included! Please read carefully as ALL SALES ARE FINAL! Happy Bidding and please see my other auctions! Buyer pays actual shipping and insurance! Only Serious Bids PLEASE_ I accept credit cards through PAYPAL!

This rich hue speaks of elegant confidence so natural and beautiful that it brings sighs of delight to all that see it! This lovely gown is 100% pure luxurious silk exclusive of the matching silky-soft light silver polyester lining. Manufacturer's tag thoughtfully provides a small bag of replacement beads and sequins, though it is for future repairs - please be aware this is a New With Tags item. Exquisitely embellished with a row of matching sequins nestling between double rows of pearly tube bead trim at the hem, slit, neck, back keyhole and sleeves. This breathtaking gown speaks volumes about the femininity in your soul! And ladies? If you thought the front of this gown was exquisite, the back is absolutely heart-robbing! Just wait until you turn to walk away and they get a look at the back of this breathtaking gown!!! There is a seductive 22_ back walking slit that provides comfort while walking/dancing and shows the perfect amount of beautiful legs as you walk away! Truly one of those breathtaking gowns that will have everyone talking about - and envying - the lovely, lucky little siren who wears it with style!

Check out my other auctions for more good buys to save on shipping and handling. Obtaining the high bid on multiple auctions will result in combined packaging which results in lower S&amp;H costs. Check back weekly at Ebay ID (pdoty) for interesting items. High bidder shall include $8.00 for priority S&amp;H in the USA, International rates will be calculated later. MO means immediate shipment while personal checks will delay shipping for 10 days. Credit cards payments can be made through PayPal.com, a new FREE on-line payment service. This method of payment saves you a trip to the Bank or Post Office plus allows me to ship your items much sooner than any other method. I ship within 24 hours of you making payment through this service. Check it out!! Click on the logo below to get to PayPal. Thanks! Sizing information: The most important measurement for the tuxedos is the chest which is measured all the way around just under the armpits and over the rear shoulder blades and then add 1-2 inches. That will give you the jacket size. Most jackets are available in short, regular, and long. If you are a weightlifter or very muscular you may want to go up one size. Please take the time to make sure the jacket and pants you are bidding on will fit you. If you need to exchange a jacket or pants for another size there will be a $20 fee which will cover my time and the cost of mailing the replacement. Thanks!</Description>

    <Description>tux# 109 #111--- This Black tuxedo was "UNION MADE IN THE USA" by Christian Dior. This tuxedo originally cost $450!! This is a quality wool tuxedo not polyester like some that are sold on ebay. This black tuxedo has an attractive cross weave that up close appears like a tiny pinstripe (the close-up shows this) It has satin notched lapels and a self-faced collar . The pants have a satin stripe. The shirt, vest, and tie is not included as I'm out of those. This one is dry clean only. It came from my tuxedo rental business and is in very nice condition. Have you checked the price of renting a Tuxedo lately??? This tuxedo rents for around $80 in most rental stores and that's for just one night!! . Why rent when you can own for less$$$??? Check out the other Tuxedos I have on eBay to save on shipping. At this price you can afford several!! Measurements can be found below.*** Click here to see my eBay "ME" page TUXEDOS You can also e-mail any questions - e-mail me! Be sure to check out all of my tuxedo auctions. You_ll surely find that special one you_re looking for. Trusted eBay member since 1998 All suits have been hanging in storage. *** Measurements (approx.)Length (top of collar to hem in back): ----32", with no vent in the back---- Shoulder Width (across the top,following the angle of the shoulders): 19"---- Sleeve length (shoulder seam to wrist,outside): 25"---- Chest width (all the way around under the arms): 41"----Pants waist: 33"-35"---- Pants Inseam: 30" with 5" hemmed . THANKS FOR YOUR INTEREST, PDOTY WITH ALL THE TROUBLE EBAY HAS BEEN HAVING I WOULD ADVISE BIDDERS THAT ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN THIS ITEM TO PLACE THE VERY HIGHEST BID THAT YOU WOULD BE WILLING TO PAY THE FIRST TIME YOU BID. IF YOU DON'T YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GET BACK INTO THE AUCTION SITE NEAR THE END TO UP YOUR BID. WITH ALL THE ADVERTISING EBAY HAS BEEN DOING THE AUCTION SITES SEEM TO GO SLOOOOOOOWWW NEAR THE END IF THE AUCTIONS END AT PRIME TIME. SO BE SAFE AND BID YOUR HIGHEST BID IN THE BEGINNING INSTEAD OF TRYING TO GET IN AT THE LAST MINUTE. WATCH FOR BIDSNIPERS--THEY WILL PLACE BIDS IN THE LAST 2 MINUTES OF AN AUCTION TO STEAL IT AWAY FROM YOU!! BE SAFE AND BID YOUR MAX EARLY!! Check my feedback and bid with confidence! Check out my other auctions for more good buys to save on shipping and handling. Obtaining the high bid on multiple auctions will result in combined packaging which results in lower S&amp;H costs. Check back weekly at Ebay ID (pdoty) for interesting items. High bidder shall include $8.00 for priority S&amp;H in the USA, International rates will be calculated later. MO means immediate shipment while personal checks will delay shipping for 10 days. Credit cards payments can be made through PayPal.com, a new FREE on-line payment service. This method of payment saves you a trip to the Bank or Post Office plus allows me to ship your items much sooner than any other method. I ship within 24 hours of you making payment through this service. Check it out!! Click on the logo below to get to PayPal. Thanks! Sizing information: The most important measurement for the tuxedos is the chest which is measured all the way around just under the armpits and over the rear shoulder blades and then add 1-2 inches. That will give you the jacket size. Most jackets are available in short, regular, and long. If you are a weightlifter or very muscular you may want to go up one size. Please take the time to make sure the jacket and pants you are bidding on will fit you. If you need to exchange a jacket or pants for another size there will be a $20 fee which will cover my time and the cost of mailing the replacement. Thanks!!</Description>

Shades of Venom contain conditioners and gloss, so it's all you need. The shade offered in this auction is FOXGLOVE-a perfct nude. Photo is not great but you can see the colors online at the Duwop site a little better. Retail is $15.00...see www.duwoponline.com for more information. Shipping is $3.90 for priority.

    <Description>This is an incredible Fox? fur coat, size 8 that my grandmother has had for approx 40 years. It was purchased at Bloomingdale's and is part of the Northern Lights fur collection. I have never owned a fur coat so I cant say for sure it's fox but we all think thats what it looks like. This coat is 100% top of the line soft &amp; incredible and in new condition, there are no stains or tears anywhere on this coat. There is extra fur in the front and the jacket is approx 3 ft. long. There is a tag that says the jacket is a size 8 and the name Marily has been embroidered on the inside of the coat when she bought it. The coat will come with the blue storage bag and a large black hanger. This is right in time for the holidays, get that special woman in your life a vintage fur for a fraction of the cost! The colors are mainly browns with some black fur mixed in, and the side pockets are leather lined. Please email me if you have specific questions and I will do my best to answer them for you! have set what I believe to be a very reasonable reserve, and winner will pay $15 S/H to any US address and insurance will be extra if desired by the winning bidder. International shipping can be arranged and actual shipping costs will be paid by the winning bidder. Again, please email me if you have any other questions, thanks for bidding and good luck! As always, if you end my Auction with Buy It Now, Shipping handling &amp; insurance are paid at my expense! I accept pay pal (preferred) money orders and personal checks.</Description>

    <Description>This is an adroable grey pleated skirt. It's pretty short. It looks great with fishnets or knee socks and a blouse with a cardigan sweater. Oh yeah, don't forget the doc martins! The skirt is 50% Polyester 50% Rayon, which results in a more cotton-y feeling, but without the static cling. It's a size 7. The waist is 29". It has a side zipper opening. It is 15" long down the front. Excellent condition. Feel free to email me with any questions. Buyer pays shipping $5.00. I accept checks, money orders, ebay payments, well concealed cash. I can no longer accept paypal credit card payments, but I can accept funds transfers. Thanks for looking! Good luck! Happy holidays! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>What a warm and stylish way to celebrate the Christmas season. This coat is gorgeous. Styled from artic lynx pelts all fully let out. It has always been stored and cleaned properly and has been recently glazed and appraised. (Apprasial will be included with purchase) This coat would best fit a size 6 - 10, but please go by the measurements. Shoulder to shoulder (outside), 24" (inside) 17", sleeve length from collar to cuff, 27", overall length is a generous 49", and a magnificent sweep of 69"! To the best of my knowledge I can count 10 - 11 full pelts in this coat, mostly in its amazing back sweep. The collar is notched, the waist is somewhat fitted, and the skirt of the coat is very full and hangs beautifully. Many coats out there have no shape and hang straight up and down, this one swishes when you walk. Very elegant and oh so warm, but without weight. The lining is a rich taupe satin in good condition. My pictures were taken in the out of doors so the colors are true. It's amazing how the fur blows in the wind. Please email me if you have other questions. Merry Christmas!</Description>

    <Description>Please read my terms first! I hold no responsibility for the mistakes of those who bid before reading--these are important! *No reserve on any of my auctions! *Winning bidder to pay actual shipping *I accept money orders, cashier's checks or personal checks (sorry, no credit cards.) NO Paypal *Payment MUST be received in 10 days. Deadbeat bidders will be handled with a lack of care. *I reserve the right to cancel any bids from those with excessive negative feedback (ie, more negative than positive, or a history of nonpayment.) I also reserve the right to hold checks for 7-10 days on bidders with low feedback or a history of bad checks. If eBay is slow in announcing the end of the auction or if you have questions, or if a picture does not come up, I can be reached at asunwolf@hotmail.com . For the end of the year I'm having a $2 sale! All items listed have a $2 starting bid, no matter their value! Check my auctions all throughout the rest of December for great deals! I feel like Cinderella's sister because I can't fit my feet into these pretty shoes :( They're red with red lace covering them--I've never seen that done! They're a size 5 (if you need specific measurements, email me at asunwolf@hotmail.com ) and have a 2 inch heel. They've been worn a touch, but the soles are still in great shape and the lace is intact except for one tiny edge on each shoe right where the heel meets the sole of the heel--barely noticable, and easily tamed with a drop of clear nail polish--hardly a danger to the rest of the lace! They're absolutely beautiful, and would spice up any wardrobe! Bid now on these unique heels! Happy bidding, and may the winner enjoy!

    <Description>A really nice jacket and a great Christmas gift. No scuffs, tears, scrathes, etc. No one will know you're wearing a used jacket - that's because it's hardly used at all! Jacket originally cost $250. Has zip up front with two snaps at bottom. Snaps on cuffs. 2 exterior pockets and an interior pocket. Underarm air holes. Lining = %100 Acetate. Shell = genuine leather. Size 38. Would fit a teen as well. Buyer pays $10 shipping. Paypal is my preferred method of payment. If you are not a member of Paypal, join under my email address - s_habeeb@hotmail.com - and I'll knock $1 of your price, plus Paypal will give you $5. I'll also accept checks and money orders.</Description>

    <Description>This is a brand new pair of adorable denim hightop sneakers from Teletubbies, for a BOY OR GIRL, in size 9. They are very well made and just adorable, and very comfortable while giving terrific support to young, developing feet. They are a deep blue denim color and have the four Teletubbies in bright color and detail on the side of each shoe! They have thick rubber soles with fantastic grip on the bottom, white rubber toe tops, and are trimmed in magenta around the edge. A patch with the Teletubbies name logo is sewn in yellow, blue and purple on the tongues of the shoes, and they lace up with sturdy white shoelaces through cute little rivet holes of blue, red, and purple. They're really adorable, and would make a super Christmas gift for the little Teletubbies fan in your house...they are no longer made, and an excellent quality shoe so this is a terrific opportunity! Like all of my items they are brand new with original tags and from a nonsmoking home. Winning bidder pays s/h of 4.00 by priority mail, insurance extra if desired. I will ship anywhere in the U.S. Money order, cashier's check or Visa/Mastercard through PayPal only (use link below to join and receive $5.00 signup bonus).

    <Description>Sexy Satin Suit from Hugo Buscati of Victoria_s Secret New! Happy Holidays! This particular party dress was purchased to wear to a wedding and I ended up a bridesmaid. I was a 4 at the time and am now a 6. I have had it hanging in the closet for 2 years and doubt that I will ever get back into it. There are tags and it has never been worn. The dress was purchased from an outlet store and is a size 4. I got it for 30% off the retail which is almost $200. It is doing me no good in my closet, so I am starting it low with NO RESERVE! This classic, sexy and easy to wear suit is perfectly suitable for a holiday party or evening out and is very sexy, though classically cut. Hugo is known for designing to fit REAL women and his clothes are cut for curves and flattering the body. He can make a gunny sack look sexy! It is a gorgeous ice pink satin. I don_t like pink, but this is a very subtle, icy color. The jacket has a front button close of pink, faux pearl buttons. The same buttons accent the sleeve cuffs. The jacket also has two besom-set pockets that are still sewn closed. It is a VERY flattering cut and reaches to just below the _BAD SPOT_ on your hips and I am 5_5_. The slim skirt is designed to end about 2_ above the knee and had a back slit, front and back darts and a button waist with back zip. Gorgeous as it is, I doubt that I will ever get back down into it, so I have no further use for this gorgeous suit. If this isn_t what you are looking for, check out my other auctions, as I am thinning my wardrobe of party dresses and formals as we never have formal occasions any more. Now shabby chic is in and we are having casual parties and fund raisers. I am even selling two of my full-length furs! Measurements are: Jacket Bust=36_ Waist= 30_ Hips= 38_ Backlength (neck to hem)=24" Shoulders=16" across Sleeve=24_ shoulder to end of cuff Skirt Waist=26_ Hips=36_ Length from bottom of Waist=19_ Winner of this auction is to pay $4.00 domestic shipping and handling including insurance. Foreign bidders to pay actual shipping and insurance. If you need it quick, use paypal and pay actual fast shipping costs. Payment accepted by domestic personal check or money order/cashier's check or Credit cards/ check by Paypal for domestic and international. Personal check will delay shipment by up to 7 days. Contact will be made upon close of auction, respond within 3 days and payment expected within 10 days or item will be relisted and negative feedback left. All sales final unless not as described.

    <Description>LADIES MY SHOES ARE FINALLY HERE! GRAB THESE GREAT BARGAINS WHILE YOU CAN! Step by step, style's never felt so good. Birkenstock is a name that's synonymous with comfort, and these double-strap sandals are no exception. They're designed with a Birko-Flor upper and two adjustable straps that reach across the vamp of your foot. Birko-Flor is a man-made, leather-like fabric that's easy to care for and has little break-in time. The sandals have suede sock liners and are built on the original Birkenstock cork foot bed with molded heel cups that absorb shock and provide support. A toe bar encourages the natural gripping of the toes while the sandal's slip-on styling makes them easy to slide into.

    <Description>Dr. Martens (Doc) Pink Shoes NEW UK 2 US 4 Aloha and welcome to RainbowResale! Brand new with tags (no box), these show light shelf wear and markings from handling. These are real Dr. Martens from England. Size UK 2 which is equal to a US womens 4 (UK+2) or boys US 3 (UK+1). Sole measures 10 inches from heel to toe. Pink and purple leather upper with Air Wair cushion sole. T-bar style with buckle. Very nice high quality expensive shoes that usually run in the $80-$100 range! Comes from a non-smoking home. Condition Range Scale: new/nwt-excellent-very good-good-fair-poor. All items have no known flaws (including rips, stains, known irregularities) unless stated otherwise. Payment and Shipping (International bidders see info below.) U.S. Shipping is $3.95 for Priority Mail. I do not charge a handling fee with Priority Mail. Estimated delivery is currently unpredictable, based on recent experience it can take anywhere from 3 to 15 days. Postal insurance is encouraged for an additional $1.10 (I am not responsible for items once they enter the postal system). I PREFER PAYPAL. I accept PayPal, money orders and cashier_s checks, all of which are shipped within 2-3 business days after I receive payment (M-F). Cash is strongly discouraged and is at your own risk (no change)! I also accept personal checks from bidders with 0 negative feedback regarding payment, but checks are least preferred and there is a 7-10 day hold on packages unless you have a feedback rating of 50+ positives with 0 negatives. There is a $10 fee in addition to pricey bank charges for bounced checks. Payment is due within 10 days of auction closing. I leave negative feedback to non-payers. I have to ask that buyers leave feedback first and I promise to return the favor for every timely payer. I am running out of ideas on how to encourage feedback (due to less than 20% of buyers leaving feedback). In the spirit of a true auction, ALL SALES ARE FINAL.

INTERNATIONAL BIDDERS PLEASE READ: By bidding you agree to pay for shipping (Airmail or Global Priority) plus a $3 handling fee, and payment must be through PAYPAL, BidPay.com, or a money order IN U.S. FUNDS. Cash is strongly discouraged and is at your own risk! The handling fee is not negotiable. Shipping cost depends on the weight of the item and your location.</Description>
