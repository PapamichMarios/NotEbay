Both are searching for a reason to live and find it in each other's arms. Buyer prepays price of movie plus $4.00 shipping and handling via USPS 1st class rate. Payment can be made by check, money order, or by credit card through Paypal. Payment must be made within 10 days of the close of the auction. Please view my other movies on auction and save on shipping. I list hundreds of movies every week. So that you may want to make many purchases I have lowered my shipping charges for multiple purchases. I charge $4.00 for the first movie, $2.00 for the second, and $1.00 for each additional movie. I allow seven days between the close of the first auction and the last. I highly recommend that insurance be purchased for videos shipped in the United States. I cannot and will not be held responsible for movies lost or damaged in the mail. Insurance only costs $1.10 to insure the delivery. If living outside the U.S. postage will be higher and the cost will be confirmed after the auction has closed. International orders cannot be insured. The costs are quite high to do this. All of our movies are previously viewed unless otherwise indicated. The picture depicted is not necessarily the one that is available due to the fact that some movies have various sleeves. Please do not bid if you do not intend to purchase. A $20 dollar service charge will be assessed for bad checks.

    <Description>This VHS video is The Buddha of Suburia. His father said "Pursue the path to happiness" ~ Karim took the road to sex, drugs and rock 'n roll. At the heart of this urban adventure is the coming of age story of Karim, son of an assimilated Indian businessman in London. When his Zen-obsessed father becomes a star guru of the swinging suburban scene, Karim is swept up into a world of theater, art, drugs, rock 'n' roll and sexual exploration. But, in the tradition of Kureshi's other acclaimed films, "Sammy and Rosie Get Laid" and "My Beautiful Launderettes," Karim must also wrestle with his sense of identity as an Indian, as an Englishman, and as a man. It may not be enlightenment, but it sure is awakening! Starring Naveen Andrews, Brenda Blethyn and Roshan Seth and winner of seven international film awards, it's a high energy flashback that captures the spirit and excitement of this magical era in perfect pitch. This video is new and in the original shrink wrap. This movie is in color and is 220 minutes long. The movie is from BBC Video. It is a two volume box set.

This is a Charlie Brown classic that covers all the basics: Homework during Christmas break and finding someone to kiss when the clock strikes midnight. Poor Charlie Brown has been given a doozy of a homework assignment...read War and Peace over Christmas vacation.

FLYPAPER - Lucy Liu Illeana Douglas, Lucy Liu, Robert Loggia, Craig Sheffer, James Wilder, John C.

Three separate but interconnected stories, all set on a deceptively sunny day in California and centered around one million dollars in cash, inspire Hoch's quirky characters to commit acts both devious and depraved in an attempt to make the big score.

About The Lucy Show Tackling a series on her own, without husband Desi Arnaz, Lucille Ball firmly established herself as the first lady of American television with this long-running series. With one exception, the supporting cast underwent numerous changes over the years, and at one time included both of Miss Balls real-life children. The one exception was Gale Gordon, who provided Lucy with a stubborn, stuffy foil for most of the shows run. The real constant, however, was Lucy and her special brand of slapstick humor, played off of all sorts of guests and regulars. About Our Products Each week we list hundreds of cds, videos and dvds.

    <Description>SCARLETT STREET*EDWARD G. ROBINSON*NEW VHS _ _ __ ___ ____ _____ ______ ______ ______ ______ _____ _____ ______ ______ _______ ________ _________ _________ __________ ___________ ___________ ____________ _Description ___________ __________ __________ ___________ ____________ ____________ _____________ _______________ THIS IS A BRAND NEW, STILL FACTORY SEALED VIDEO. "SCARLETT STREET" Stars Edward G. Robinson, Arthur Loft, Dan Duryea, Jess Barker, Joan Bennett, Margaret Lindsay, Rosalind Ivan, Samuel S. Hinds Film Credits Fritz Lang Producer Dudley Nichols Screenwriter Milton Krasner Director of Photography Arthur Hilton Editor Synopsis Christopher Cross, a quiet and staid cashier with dreams of becoming a painter, feels consumed by passion for the first time in his life when he meets pretty, manipulative Kitty. The two become involved, but Kitty is really in love with petty crook Johnny--she keeps Christopher around simply for his money. In order not to lose his precious mistress, Cross embezzles funds from his employer; he doesn't realize, however, that Kitty and Johnny are also getting rich on his paintings, which are becoming a huge success under Kitty's name. When Christopher's theft comes to light, he loses his job and his dignity. And when he seeks out Kitty for solace, he discovers her in Johnny's embrace. Furious, Christopher stabs Kitty repeatedly with an icepick. Then, he stands coldly by as Johnny is implicated, and finally executed, for the crime. Description In this remake of Jean Renoir's controversial 1931 film, LA CHIENNE, Christopher Cross (Edward G. Robinson), a quiet, staid cashier and dedicated Sunday painter, feels consumed by passion for the first time in his life when he meets pretty, manipulative Kitty. The two become involved, but Kitty is really in love with petty crook Johnny. She keeps Christopher around simply for his money. In order to impress his precious mistress, Cross embezzles funds from his employer. He doesn't realize, however, that Kitty and Johnny are also getting rich on his paintings, which are becoming a huge success under Kitty's name. When Christopher's theft comes to light, he loses his job and his dignity. And when he seeks out Kitty for solace, he discovers her in Johnny's embrace. The film explodes in its violent climax, and with it Lang creates perhaps his most chilling Film Noir work. The tightly structured story and the evocative paintings that lie symbolically at the center of the plot create a visual and psychological atmosphere of suspense, filled with double meanings and games of representation and appearance, all pointing toward a brutal final act, motivated by Cross' inner demons and repressed emotions. Film Notes Theatrical release: December 28, 1945. SCARLET STREETwas filmed in Los Angeles in 1945. SCARLET STREET was the first film in the partnership between Lang, leading lady Joan Bennet and her husband , producer Walter Wagner. Fritz Lang's SCARLET STREET has the same leading actors as his 1941 film, THE WOMAN IN THE WINDOW. _____________ ____________ ____________ ___________ __________ _________ _________ ________ _______ _______ ________ _________ _________ __________ ___________ ___________ ____________ _Payment and Shipping Info ___________ __________ __________ ___________ ____________ ____________ _____________ ________________ Buyer to pay shipping and handling of $3.75.

    <Description>EXPLOITATION CARTOONS OF THE _30s &amp; _40s FEATURING AMOS &amp; ANDY Most of these ultra rare cartoons have not been seen on television or in theatres in over forty years. Produced at a time when the general public was tolerant (or ignorant) of social stereotypes these cartoons through the years have been disowned by modern broadcasters and, in most cases, by the original producers themselves. Whether they_re looked at by today_s audiences as entertainment, historical or offensive, you can_t deny their existance or rarity. BUYERS NOTE: This tape is derived from a varierty of sources, as a result quality varies considerably from cartoon to cartoon. VIDEO CONTENT: _Rassling Match_ &amp; _The Lion Tamer_ featuring Amos &amp; Andy (the original actors from the radio series do these cartoons). Tom &amp; Jerry in _Plane Dumb_ (two white guys donning black face to _blend in_ in Africa). Bugs Bunny in _All This And Rabbit Stew_ (Bugs being pursued by a black hunter) and War Bonds (Bugs doing a black face Al Jolson routine). The Walter Lantz cartoon _Scrub Me Mama With A Boogie Beat_. A 10 minute short called _Jungle Jitters_ about a salesman being captured by black headhunters and, the most famous (or infamous) of all, the Celebrity Pictures production of _Little Black Sambo_ VIDEO QUESTIONS: This write-up usually covers the most common video questions so please read on.. Video copy is new, VHS, SP standard mode NTSC (playable on all Canadian, U.S and standard Japanese VCR's) and is manufactured and distributed by our public domain company Buyers Gallery Video unless noted. The picture and audio quality on these tapes is overall good but bear in mind that these titles are made from vintage reels and the quality is indicative of the technology of the particular era, so please be realistic in your expectations and don_t expect DVD quality from films, in some cases, almost 100 years old. Any title that is _below par_ is noted in video description as best as possible.. Video comes in a hardshell plastic library case with the photo seen above printed on white stock. In the rare occasion of a defective tape it will be exchanged for the same title.. We DO NOT sell or wholesale to other video companies, sell throughs or video stores. SHIPPING RATES: North American shipping rate is $4.50 for air mail. International is higher. International biddders please inquire before bidding. Since the post office doesn't let us negotiate postal rates with them we in turn ask that you respect the fact that we cannot accept _offers_ on postage. Multiple wins will be combined to reduce cost to buyers . CHECK OUT OUR PICTURE GALLERY FOR MORE FILMS, CDs AND MEMORABILIA</Description>

    <Description>KOYAANISQATSI - An art-house circuit sensation, this feature-length documentary is visually arresting and possesses a clear, pro-environmental political agenda. Without a story, dialogue, or characters, Koyaanisqatsi (1983) (the film's title is a Hopi word roughly translated into English as "life out of balance") is composed of nature imagery, manipulated in slow motion, double exposure or time lapse, juxtaposed with footage of humans' devastating environmental impact on the planet. Starting with an ancient rock wall painting, the film moves through sequences depicting clouds, waves, and other natural features, then into man-made landscapes such as buildings, earth-altering construction machinery, and cars. The message of director Godfrey Reggio is clear: humans are destroying the planet, and all of human progress is pointlessly foolish. Also notable for its intense, atmospheric score by new age composer Philip Glass, Koyaanisqatsi (1983) was a labor of love for Reggio, who spent several years filming it. The film was followed by sequels, Powaqqatsi (1988), Anima Mundi (1991) and Naqoyqatsi (1999). All movies are former Video Update rentals and have cut-box art. These particular movies are exceptionally clean minus a few stickers. All movies have been tested to insure a quality playback and are priced to MOOOVE!! So bid in confidence. Thanks for reading and good luck! Priority USPS shipping and handling anywhere in the U.S. of A only $4.00.

    <Description>Emmet Otter's Jug-Band Christmas VHS NEW, Factory Sealed. This item is obtained directly from our authorized wholesale distributor. It is new and unopened, in the original factory shrink wrap. These are not dubbed or copied, but are the genuine products available here in the U.S. Please beware of others' "copied" products. Starring: The Muppets NTSC format (US and Canada only) Color, HiFi Sound, Animated, NTSC Originally a special for HBO, this Jim Henson production (he also directed) was one of the first real forays into the more realistic, less vaudevillian direction for the Muppets. It also included Frank Oz (Muppeteer), Paul Williams (songs), and Jerry Juhl (script), some of the Muppet Show's usual suspects. Emmet Otter and his jug band are trying out in the local talent show, but they face fierce competition from a gang of toughs, the Riverbottom Gang and their rock band. Perhaps the most notable thing is the creation of a sense of poverty and want that suffuses the little production. Even Emmet's mother, who sacrifices her washtub to further Emmet's cause, gets in the act. Fine Christmas viewing for all ages. My sister, brother and I never missed this Muppet special when it used to air in the 70's. It remains a family favorite to this day, thanks to Nickolodeon re-runs and this edited-but-still-viable video copy. Emmet and his mother would like to "just once," have a "store-bought" Christmas for each other. In our materialistic culture, the love these characters have for each other and their pleasure in the small wonders of life are a lesson to us all. The sweet-faced animal characters, their beautiful voices, and the message about true giving make this a fun and very meaningful holiday special. Thanks to Russell and Lillian Hoban, who wrote the wonderful book upon which this is based, and to Jim Henson and Paul Williams for bringing it to life. They've given us a great gift, and I can't wait to share it with my own children someday.

    <Description>BRAND NEW WITH TAGS STILL ATTACHED BABY GAP VERSATILE WHITE TURTLENECK SHIRT This wonderful top, made by Baby Gap, is absolutely adorable and would make a perfect addition to your baby's layette wardrobe. It is size medium, 6-12 months. It is solid white. It has long sleeves and a turtleneck style collar. It snaps at the shoulder for easy dressing. My favorite feature is the "onsie-styling" that snaps between the legs, so it doesn't come untucked! This top is 100% cotton. The classic styling and basic layette color make is very versatile. A great coordinate for many of your little one's clothing. Definately a wardrobe MUST for your baby! This shirt is brand new with tags still attached. I bought this to coordinate with a pair of gray velvet Baby Gap biboveralls and a red plaid Baby Gap shirt. The three pieces were to be worn together as an outfit. The white turtleneck with the biboveralls and the plaid shirt on top, unbuttoned, as an "over shirt." It really looked great on the store display manequin. Unfortunately, it just didn't get cold enough here last winter to wear this layered look, so this turtleneck was never worn. I have the gray velvet Baby Gap biboveralls and the red plaid Baby Gap shirt for sale in other auctions if you are interested. Together, the three make a fabulous, and very fashionable, outfit for your little one! Please email me if you have any questions or would like additional pictures of this shirt. We have a smoke free home and it will arrive clean, pressed, and ready for your little one to enjoy! Please see my other auctions for more high quality, brand name baby clothing, toys, and other infant items. I am listing, and will continue to list, many more baby items. Fabulous things are being outgrown by my baby so quickly! I will gladly combine winning auctions to help reduce shipping costs. Please note that all sales are final. Serious US bidders only. Buyer agrees to pay actual shipping cost plus an additional 50 cents handling fee per auction. Insurance is optional and available at buyer's request for an additional cost. If you do not want insurance, I cannot be responsible for items once they are mailed. Money orders, cashier's checks, and concealed cash payments only! Payment must be received within 10 days of auction end or I will relist item and leave negative feedback. Thank you for looking at my auction. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>A red shirt with blue trim around the collar and the wrists. It has three snap buttons running down from the collar. The overalls are fleecy and warm. They have two snaps on each side so they can be adjusted in case of growth spurts. A V with a teddy bear and football accents the center of the outfit with the words "Varsity Cub" underneath. This outfit is in great condition. Almost like new. I paid $32.99. Size 24 months. This shirt will look very in season for the holidays coming upon us. It's very warm and fuzzy in a nice shade of green. In the center of the shirt is a plaid bear. The same plaid trims the hem of the shirt. The jeans are in great condition with very minimal fading in the knees. A terrific little boy outfit! The shirt is 24 months and the jeans are 2T, but my son wore them both together. This shirt is like a thermal fabric in a deep reddish burgundy shade. It has blue trim around the collar, yellow trim around one wrist and green trim around the other wrist. The overalls are just you classic denim. This outfit is in great condition. Size 24 months. The green pajamas with purple trim are by Gerber and are in very nice condition. Size 2T. The red pajamas are by Carter's and are in very nice condition. Size 2T. The shirt is kind of fleecy, in yellow/gold, navy and red. A zipper runs down from the collar and it reads: "Bear rides his bike on the trails" across the middle of the shirt and shows various pictures pertaining to trails and woods. The pants are navy with a red drawstring waistband and yellow cuffing at the ankles. This outfit looks almost brand new. It is by 2nd Step and was purchased at Kohl's Department Store for $32.99. Size 24 months. This adorable lion sweatsuit outfit is just as precious as can be. The shirt has a lion on the front. If you pressed the nose it used to roar, but the sound effect is no longer working. A hood is attached to the shirt with a fringed mane and ears. The pants are plain sweats the same color as the shirt. This outfit is in nice condition, except it does have those little "nubbies" that sweats always get after repeated washings. Size 2T. Also included in this lot which isn't pictured is a burgundy colored Gap turtleneck in size XXS. It is in excellent, like new condition. Please ask any question prior to bidding as all sales are final. Winning bidder is to pay for shipping and insurance, if insurance is desired.

    <Description>...U.M.S. Levi_s Osh Kosh U.M.S. Levi_s Osh Kosh... 3 pairs of boys pants Size 24m (plus or minus...) You are looking at 3 pairs of little boy_s pants. What you get is first: plaid teal, maroon, black and white 100% cotton pants by U.M.S size 2. These have an elasticized waist and cuffs. No pockets... pretty much just a gently worn pair of pants without stains or rips or holes and no knee or seat wear. Second is a pair of light blue, lightly distressed Levi_s jeans. The classic brown tag on the back says size 0 W 18 L 13. These fit about an 18-24 month child. These have two small brown, faded stains on the left leg near the seam. I didn_t see them till now, but they are very faded and a shot of _Shout_ might work. These have been gently broken in and show a little knee wear. Third are a pair of Osh Kosh plaid pants. Blue, green, red and white. Size 24M 100% cotton. Elastic waistband, faux fly, two front and two back pockets, very cute with 4 little brass rivets at the corners of the front pockets. No knee or seat wear, no holes, rips or stains _ just very gently worn. Buyer to pay $3.45 for S &amp; H. Please email me with any questions you might have. Payment methods accepted are: Instant cash transfer from your existing PayPal account eCheck through your PayPal account _ this usually takes 3-4 days to _clear_ Money Order (Postal MO, if possible, please) NOTE : I can't accept credit cards through PayPal. I'll ship your item out when I receive payment notification from PayPal or receive your Money Order. Let me know how you are going to pay so I don't bug you... I realize getting a Money Order takes a day or two, but I have been _stung_ recently by a couple of deadbeats who have made me cautious. Payment MUST be received within 10 days of the auction closing or I_ll relist and sadly give you a negative feedback (PLEASE don_t make me have to do this!) Thank you! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information. Payment Instructions I am not participating in eBays Checkout process. I'll email you shourtly after this auction ends and let you know your total, etc. Have a great day and thank you for looking (and hopefully bidding!)</Description>

    <Description>I can not believe I am putting this up for auction it is going to be hard to let go of this set! So here goes the details... a beautiful sage green colored long sleeve tee 100% cotton with a removable(velcro very well hidden) signature Mimi Rose flower. Please note there is a small rip(at seam) that I marked on one of the photos. It is very unoticable and repairable. 1/8 of an inch long or less. Next... a comfortable pair of bloomers same color and material as shirt. No exposed elastic to itch your little one, only the cotton to touch their skin. Finally... there is the greatest crocheted darker sage green hat with coordinating flower at the center. You will be in love with this the minute you see it on I promise. That is it! The most wonderful set sure to be a instant favorite. I hope this goes to a special little girl who can wear it many times with style just then I will be able to get over selling it. What good is it going to do in keepsake box at my house?? Important Info: Winning Bidder to pay 3.50 priority shipping. Most items ship within 24 hours of receipt of payment. I prefer Paypal, Billpoint, money orders, cashier's checks, sorry NO PERSONAL CHECKS. Payment is expected within 10 days of auction close. All items are from a very clean, non-smoking home. I will automatically and gladly combine shipping on multiple wins. Thank you for looking. Please check back soon for new listings.</Description>

    <Description>_ _ CUTE SNOWSUIT SZ 24 MO! _ This auction is for an awesome snowsuit/bunting in a size 24 months! It is a baby blue polyester/cotton blend and is extremely warm! It has a drawstring, acrylic lined hood and zips completely down each leg, which makes it unbelievably easy to get a sleeping child in and out of it or to change a diaper. It has ribbed knit cuffs at the wrists and ankles and even has buttons to attach mittens and snowboots to! The front has a cute applicated bunny with a rattle. This wonderful snowsuit is fully lined in nylon and stuffed with 100% polyester fiberfill for warmth. It is in excellent condition and the only thing it is missing is the little button that holds the neck shut (easily replaced!). My ex-mother-in-law gave me this for my 2 year old not realizing he wears a size 5T. She doesn't need it back so I am giving someone else the opportunity to own it. *All of my items come from a smoke-free/pet-free home!!* ~~~~Buyer is to pay $4.35 for Priority shipping and delivery confirmation. I accept Paypal (seller I.D. hummingbirdsales@aol.com), certified bank checks, WELL concealed cash (at your own risk) &amp; money orders. Sorry, NO PERSONAL CHECKS!!!

    <Description>Petit Bateau designer romper size 3 month. Heavy quilted velour with the PB emblem embroidered on left side in the same shade of pink. Sets of tiny white buttons up the front and snap bottom for easy diaper changes. This is a wonderfully soft and warm outfit for the winter. High quality and in great condition. There is a slight yellowing on either side of the top buttons but very faint and hard to see (it shows up more in the picture). No other stains or tears and from a pet free and smoke free home. This is still a great outfit for your little one and a brand only found in top department stores and boutiques! I will be putting more of my daughter_s first year clothing on auction over the next few days. Everything was purchased new over the last year and worn by only one little girl! I prefer paypal but accept money orders, cashiers checks and billpoint. Buyer pays shipping. I will happily combine shipping for multiple winning auctions. Good Luck!</Description>

    <Description>These are Gymboree leggings in a size XX-small or about 12-18 months of age. I believe that they are from the Wildflowers line. They are a lilac purple background with a floral print all over them. This is in excellent condition. There are no stains, rips or holes. There is no fading that I can see. This comes from a non-smoking home. Shipping is $2.00 to the US only. I accept Paypal (kgnac@g2a.net), money order and cashier's check. I will not accept any bids from anyone whose total feedback rating is negative (like _1, etc). I usually am able to ship items within a day or two of receiving payment which gets the item to you very quickly. I expect a response from the high bidder within 3 days. If I do not receive any response within a 7 day timeframe, I will leave negative feedback and file a non-paying bidder report. I do my absolute best to accurately describe all items. Therefore, all sales are final.</Description>

    <Description>This is a lot of three fleece items sizes 12/14. They are - one hooded pullover made by Alaska Wear from the softest burgundy polar fleece I've ever felt, one zip neck pullover from GH Bass in green polar fleece (some pilling from the wash), and lastly a button up "big" shirt from NorthCrest in a soft denim blue polar fleece. All are marked from 12/14 to 14/16, but fit like a 12. Feel free to email me with any question... I answer them all! Shipping is $6.00 Priority mail. Thanks for your interest &amp; Happy Holidays!</Description>

It is red with a football scene across the chest 2)Golden yellow shirt, T.K.S. brand, waffle weave knit, great condition. Maybe worn twice. No wear and tear on either of these shirts. 3)Maverick brand 7 regular jeans, great for play. Jeans show a little wear on the knees but is limited to a little fading-no holes or even thinning of the denim. Probably not worth mentioning but we take pride in accurate descriptions!

    <Description>*~* 18 - 24 Month *~* This is a 7 piece mixed lot of 18 - 24 Month boys clothing. First is a pair of blue Old Navy overalls. These have lots of pockets. They show a touch of fading, and there are a couple of spots where they look darker in those areas. Perhaps you know how to treat that? There is also one tiny tiny bleach spot on one side pocket. They are in great condition other than those spots! Next is an off white and blue striped onesie from Old navy. This is a thermal type of fabric. It has a few faint spots on it, but has tons of life left! It has no holes or tears or anything. Next is a two piece sweatsuit by Okie Dokie. The pants are green, and the top has race cars all over it and green at the waist, sleeve cuffs, and neckline. I see no spots or anything on the pants, and they are in excellent condition. The shirt has a few faint spots on it, but is in overall very good condition. 5th and 6th is a yellow pair of playskool yellow pajamas, and the pants snap to the top. There are animals on the front of the shirt. This shows quite a bit of wear, and I see a couple of faint spots on the shirt, but none on the pants. These are size 18 month but everything else is 18-24, except the blanket sleeper I am about to describe, which is 2T. It is a green, and blue Evenflo blanket sleeper with footies. There is some faint staining on the bottoms of the feet, but that's all. It shows wear also. Shipping will be actual costs only for priority shipping. This comes from a SMOKE FREE home. I accept Paypal, Billpoint, YahooPayDirect, Money Orders, and Checks. I don't accept credit card payments through paypal. If you would like to use a credit card please use Billpoint or Yahoo PayDirect. Personal checks will be held for clearance before I ship. Payment is expected within 10 days of auctions end.

There are ruffles of striped white and chambray and a sweet pink gingham and folded rose on the pointed collar. There are sashes (slight wear) to form a bow in back and tiny blue buttons secure this sweety on the back bodice. There are no rips, stains or fading to be found on this cutie by Bonnie Jean. It has had its size tags removed, but is equivalent to a 4/5, measuring 25 inches from shoulder to hem. *If The Photos Do Not Load, Please Reload/Refresh!* *By Bidding on my item, you are entering into a legally binding contract and you are agreeing to the terms and conditions below.* Buyer to pre-pay Shipping, Priority USPS &amp; Handling costs of $4.00 and insurance of $1.10 for $50 of coverage, if desired, plus final bid.

Payment must be received within ten days of auction end unless otherwise arranged PRIOR to the end of the auction. I stand firm on this term; if you cannot have the payment to me within ten days, please do not bid on my item. Also, I have been filing way too many Final Value Fee Credits, and leaving Negative Feedback lately, due to non-paying customers!

I WILL leave negative feedback and re-list the item! INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS, Including Canadian: PAYPAL must be used as form of payment and shipping will be determined at end of auction. Customs Forms will all be marked MERCHANDISE as well. All sales are final unless there has been a "significant" misrepresentation of an item, and in case of a refund, only the final bid purchase price will be refunded . As you can see by my feedback, I am a completely reliable and honest seller, who checks each item as thoroughly as possible, and this term is more for my protection against those who want something for nothing! (*GASP* Yes, it does happen, as any other seller can tell you! i.e. someone staining an item, after they have used it, just so they can claim a refund) Thanks for understanding. :- ) I also have the right to decline bids from Users with excessive negative or hidden feedback. Thank you so much for looking at my auction and please view my other AUCTIONS as well for more quality Children's Clothing including many BOUTIQUE items, Collectibles, Women's Clothing and much, much more!

    <Description>This is a fantastic 7 piece lot of Gymboree and McKids outfits. Unless noted otherwise, all my clothes are gently worn, washed in cold water and line dried so they in great to like new conditon. This lot includes : (1) Gymboree Winter Bouquet 3-pc set, my all time favorite. So well made, the elbow patch on the shirt and the floral quilt on the chest are just exquisite. Gently worn, excellent conditon. The shirt and pants have zero piling. The quilted jacket has just started to fuzz very little. It has 3-4 tiny pin size stains, you really have to look very hard to find them. We were missing a button, so I changed the sleeves to heart shaped buttons. They look great. Old size XS fits 9-18 months. (2) Gorgeous green floral velvet/velour outfit, gently worn, wonderful like new conditon. Size 18 months. We got so many complments on these two outfits last year. They are just beautiful. The quilted jacket looks great with the green outfit too. Buyer pays $3.95 shipping. I try to give very detail descriptions but if you still have questions, please email me. I accept Paypal, money order, or cashier's check. Buyer agrees to pay the shipping cost. Insurance is recommended but not required as I am not responsible or item lost or damaged once I drop them off at the post office. I have other ongoing auctions of women's and children's designer wears and name brand train sets. Please check my other listings. Thanks for looking.</Description>

    <Description>This is a three piece lot of Hannas in good used condition. They are all 100% cotton and size 110 which fits children 42-46" tall, weighing 37 -48 lbs. or roughly 4-6 years. The fabric still has lots of heft and vigor. The boxy T is long sleeved, navy and turquiose, the other shirt is a cotton pique with a really cute pattern of sled dogs, snow shoes, and winter animals. The bubbly pants coordinate nicely and would be in good to excellent condition EXCEPT there is a small lightened spot on the front of the right leg, just a tiny dot, that I can't get out. I didn't notice it until I was inspecting for listing but you should know. I included a close up in case it shows up. Buyer to pay 5.00 USPS shipping and 1.00 insurance if desired. Make sure you check out my other auctions. In spite of our repeated attempts to overdress him, our son doesn't wear clothes whenever he can get away with it. All items were purchased new by me and worn (or avoided) by my son only. I inspect each item thoroughly and will not list anything with stains, worn areas, holes, or other damage. Any flaws I find I have clearly described. My rule of thumb is, if I wouldn't put my son in it (or TRY to put my son in it) I won't try to sell it to you. Thanks for looking and happy holidays.

All items are in stock and are shipped by UPS only--sorry, but we do not ship to postal box addresses as the package can not be effectively tracked while in transit. Canada and International bidders pay the actual shipping charge plus insurance and handling expenses ( CLICK HERE for more shipping, payment and auction details). Due to several non-paying overseas bidders, an International bidder must have a positive feedback of 20+ or email us first for permission to bid. International winners must use Bidpay, MoneyMover or Cash. Due to the personal nature of our items ALL SALES ARE FINAL so be sure to know your size and read the description carefully. Although our website may have a similar item available to the one that is on auction, we do not substitute/exchange items or sizes, so be sure you are bidding on the correct item and size. All auction items have been prepackaged and can originate from different warehouses, therefore we can not combine multiple auctions to reduce shipping. Email confirmation from the winner with a complete name and shipping address is due via email within 3 days of the auction close and payment must be received within 10 calendar days of the auction close in the form of PayPal, Postal/Western Union Money Order, Cashiers Check, Bidpay, MoneyMover or Cash. For faster shipping, Visa, Mastercard and eChecks are accepted securely through PayPal for shipping to confirmed domestic addresses. Please don't be one of the people left out in the cold after the auction because you were unable to bid at the last second and missed the item you wanted! If you proxy bid and secretly put in the highest you are willing to go, the system will work for you if you are away and place a high bid when it is needed to keep you a winner (this keeps the bid snipers from beating you at the last second just before the auction ends)! This will make a great C H R I S T M A S G I F T for someone you love or for yourself !!! To get your UPS domestically shipped item by Christmas, make sure payment reaches us on or before Dec 17 Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>Carrying the label stating "A VAN HEUSEN Original", this beautiful, textured tie has rich navy color with red spires and silver highlighting, dating from perhaps the late 1930s? - I'm afraid I'm uncertain of the date. A vintage white box is included. The tie measures approximately 2-3/4" wide at the bottom widest width. It is possible the tie was never worn - it is in excellent, clean condition and retains the folds from having been in this same box (please see 1st photo/scan of 3 below) for some time. The box does show wear, with wear to corners, several breaks at the sides, and cellophane tape glue remnants. Please e-mail if you have any questions, and also see the other neck-and-bow ties I have for auction this week. Shipping in the U.S. is $1.95 1st class postage; priority mail and insurance extra upon request. Michigan bidders please add 6% sales tax unless exempt. Payment by check, money order, or VISA/Master Card through PayPal. Thank you for looking in on this auction!</Description>

    <Description>Large Burma Chinese Jade Bangle bracelet 66mm Click here View the Gallery inter diameter 2 5/8 inches Or 66mm outer diameter 3 3/8 inches Or 86mm width 10mm Produce Burma natural jadeite color undyed, 100% natural A jade Green color * see picture* condition Perfect. no crack condition Translucent * see Picture* include Bangle Box FREE About A -jade. B- jade &amp; C-jade The Jadeite showing up on market presently can be classified into A jade, B jade and C jade. A- jade indicates the natural jadeite without undergoing any artificial treatment, alteration or enhancement. Such a kind of natural jadeite does not change with the passage of time. It can be preserved forever and wears well. B- Jade is defined as the natural jadeite having undergone a process of acid treatment, removed the impurities and impregnated with colloidal silica or resin. Normally, this kind of jadeite will turn out yellow gradually in 5-10 years of time and then the surface color will come off due to the ageing of resin or colloid. Meanwhile, the composition of inherent texture of jadeite has been destroyed during the acid treatment which affects immediately its durability. C-Jade is specified as the natural jadeite having undergone artificial treatment, colloid impregnation plus adding the new pigment substance.( We say dyed color) We may also say that not only its internal texture has been undermined but also its internal color was artificially added in.

    <Description>Hello and welcome to our auction! We have up for bid a pair of Black and White Nike Air Jordans ( XIII ). They are in good condition. I would rate them a solid 9 out of 10 due to the slight wear to heel part of the soles. The rest of the soles are in good condition with the herringbone traction pattern still in almost new condition. The uppers are in VERY good condition, with no major scrapes, scrathces or scuffs. However as with most of the xiii that have been worn there is some slight scuffing to the hologram. They are a size 3, but what is great about this pair is that it comes with the original box which is in almost perfect condition. These would make a great addition to your collection. Shipping will be $6.00, more for international bidders based upon where you live. Bidding starts at just $1.00 with no reserve!!!! We accept paypal, money orders and checks. Checks must clear prior to shipping. Check out my other auctions for the Jordan XI originals from 1995, Pinkerton security statues, our bomb blanket, more vintage nikes and jordans and other interesting and rare items!! Thanks for looking!!</Description>

Is fully lined with wild faux fur except the sleeves have white satiny fabric lining. Beautiful pink and rose colored flowers are embroidered on the pockets and sleeves. Retail was $68.00.

This 100% lambswool sweater is simply excellent. It is principally olive green , with stripes of a medium, French blue and cream . This sweater comes from Chaps' Rustica line and has a wonderful, classic feel to it, with the slightly fuzzy feel that comes with lambswool. The pattern is made using purl stitches, which is the reverse side of what one normally sees, giving this sweater a very distinctive appearance . It also gives a little more blur to the pattern The Chaps/Ralph Lauren hang tab is on the bottom left seam. This classic sweater is extremely versatile , equally suited to the business casual environment or your real life. Measurements are: approximately 46" chest, 28" long (measured from the top of the collar) and 21" sleeves (measured from underarm). The label has not been cut or otherwise marked. The tags are intact, including the retail price tag of $79, making it available here at a two-thirds discount .

Please provide an address other than a P.O. Box and a phone number if possible. All winning bidders will be notified when item is shipped.__ Good Luck and Happy Bidding!! _ My notes on buying gold from Thailand CLICK HERE _ An informative story about "The Myth of Thai Gold" CLICK HERE http://Federal Trade Commission /bcp/guides/jewel-gd.htm Consider these facts when buying gold jewelry A 20 inch gold rope chain can consist of only one or two grams of pure gold unless otherwise stated. Be careful! Pure gold can be flattened into a foil that is only 5/1,000,000 of an inch thick. "100 % gold" could only mean "plated with gold". The price for the gold in a 23K chain is non negotiable. There is no wholesale or retail; everyone pays the published price. However, the price of the gold jewelry is based on the cost of the gold and the cost of the workmanship that went into making the piece. Thailand ranks as the second largest jewelry exporting country in the world. "Thai Gold" is .965 fine, a little over 23K. The alloy makes the gold harder so it stands up to wear much better than the very soft 24K gold. In other Asian countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore, the gold shops sell only 24K gold and is sold by the "Tael" which is 37.5 grams. "Baht Gold" refers to "Thai Gold" .950 pure or better and is sold by the Baht weight which = 15.2 grams. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>YOU MUST READ THE BOTTOM OF MY ME PAGE BEFORE BIDDING DUE TO THE RECENT ANTHRAX ATTACK THROUGH THE POSTAL SERVICE. GYMBOREE GYMBOREE This adorable lot is my oldest daughters favorite clothes. She is selling these for christmas money. I told her she had to pick out some stuff she didnt fit anymore and I would put them up. She is almost 4 and is so excited about this christmas. Not afraid of santa this year. LOL! BUY NOW BEFORE ITS GONE. Size -Small or 2t to 3t. Color -First shirt is is just a extra we threw in because it has a little discoloration on the cuffs from playing outside. Nothing noticable, I just am a little anal when it comes to stains and what I sell. Its Blue and teal with a small zipper from neckline to middle of chest. Has a heart on left chest area, and a little bit of green around collar and heart. The second shirt was my favorite. Its a cardigan for going over a shirt. Beautiful embroidery around bottom and also on left chest area. Light blue with lime green. Snaps all the way down(no paint chipped) and has been well taken care of. It is a size x small but fits like the rest. The third item is a dress. She wore this with a shirt underneath(windy days) and a pair of leggings underneath. Beautiful blue with yellow flowers on pocket. Snaps in the back are yellow(5 in all) and 3 have a tiny scratch pin size mark. Condition -The dress and the cardigan have no stains or holes anywhere. Like I said the other shirt I threw in because the cuffs have a discoloration from playing outside but isnt noticable. Just a extra item for play or what not. All snaps and zippers are in perfect working order. All have normal wash wear. Payment -Paypal, Bidpay, Billpoint and money orders only. Payment due within 10 days of first email. Shipping rate -$3.50 Priority mail (2-3 days). Return Policy -Conditional return. If item was not authentic or as described, I will return you money back minus shipping.

    <Description>Gymboree Red Holiday Leggings (med) GREAT! You are bidding on a very nice pair of wide wale ribbed Gymboree leggings. They are a lovely holiday red, made of 80% cotton, 17% polyamide, and 3% spandex. These leggings have been gently worn and are still "like new" except for a very small tear (which has been stitched and is now unnoticeable) at the very bottom of the left pant leg. Shipping via the USPS will be either $1.26 for first class or $3.50 for priority mail. Save shipping costs by combining auctions! Thanks for looking! Buyer pays actual shipping costs. Please see the item description for first class rates and priority mail rates. If you prefer parcel post, I can certainly let you know that amount as soon as I have your zip code. Insurance is always optional. I do my best to keep your shipping cost down because I hate paying shipping costs myself. I never charge any type of handling fee. I gladly accept PAYPAL, money orders, cash, or a personal check. I do not sell anything that I would not be delighted to receive myself! Created by eBay Seller's Assistant Basic.</Description>

Thank you in advance! I reserve the right to cancel bidder's with a ZERO feedback and/or excessive negative feedback because of those out there who think ebay is a game!
