    <Description>You are bidding on a _TV One Sheet_ for the short lived television show _The Marshal" starring Jeff Fahey. The item measures approximately 8 x 11 inches. As a free bonus to bidders I will include 14 episodes (on 7 tapes) of this short-lived series on VHS (see photo of one sheet and episode descriptions below). The episodes were taped in SP mode with a 4 Head Hifi VCR and the quality is above average. SHOW SYNOPSIS: The Marshal debuted on ABC TV's primetime line-up Tuesday, January 31, 1995 bringing with it a cinematic sensibility removed from the conventions of the small-screen. A much-anticipated second-season transfusion to a formulaic action genre, this critically acclaimed contemporary crime drama starred able film-and-TV veteran Jeff Fahey as Deputy United States Marshal Winston MacBride, an unorthodox fugitive retrieval specialist with a well-earned reputation for tenacity and resourcefulness. MacBride's easy-going outward demeanor and self-effacing affability belied a hidden focus and dedication to a dangerous complex job. To an analytical postal inspector working with him on a particularly convoluted case, he once offered: "I usually just chase people." Possessing an overwhelming sense of fairness, he was quick to make difficult decisions based not necessarily upon the obvious thing to do but rather upon his estimation of the right thing to do. While more than unpredictable in his methods, he was no loose cannon. He may have tested the tensile strength of the rules from time to time but actually broke them only on the rarest of occasions. MacBride favored guile over gunplay and to the chagrin of fellow law-enforcers more often than not displayed open admiration of his more elusive quarry for their craftiness in their efforts to elude him. He was a family man. Dedicated husband to a bright career woman and loving father of two young daughters. Yet, despite his obvious devotion to them, he seemed strangely comfortable in the role of the solitary hunter during extended assignments. This apparent dichotomy set Winston MacBride apart from the character-type one might expect expect to see in an action lead. In the noir-bizarre episode, Love Is Strange, after briefly studying a sample of his handwriting, a consulting graphologist makes her skills evident to The Marshal by observing: "You don't swim with the other ducks, do you?" Extremely well-written female characters, allies and adversaries alike, were a staple of the series. The women of the episodes Hitwoman, Protection, Snow Orchid, Love Is Strange and Kissing Cousins stand out as key examples. But beyond these there are others who as well reflect a dimensionality as much exciting as reaffirming. The overall tone of The Marshal broke convention in a very clever way. Always refreshingly inventive, the show's stylishly subtle quirkiness branded it unique among the dramatic network offerings of the day. A bittersweet holiday gift to die-hard fans, the final episode (co-written by Ben Stein who also appeared in a supporting role) aired December 25, 1995. Its title proved prophetic and more than fittingly ironic: Time Off for Clever Behavior. Cast Information: Jeff Fahey .... Winston MacBride Patti Harras .... Sally McBride Brion James ....

    <Description>#1168 1958 Precious Mirror Iced Tea Spoon The lovely Precious Mirror pattern was first introduced in 1958. This 7_" iced tea spoon is marked on the back Eagle Wm. Rogers Star IS . I give all the silver I sell a light cleaning to remove tarnish that can hide damage, particularly on silverplate. There is some tarnish remaining on it, particularly around the edges of the design, that needs to be removed. There is a tiny area on the heel of the spoon which may be spots of light wear, but they also may be tarnish that didn't come off. This spoon has only started to develop a patina.

    <Description>_ _ Disney's Song of the South Video _ Walt Disney's 1946 classic 'Song of the South' Brand NEW sealed video classic. This is the original theatrical release in English without sub-titles. This is the official Disney video with the official Disney hologram seal on the cassette and artwork to Guarantee Authenticity. This video has NEVER been available in the U.S. and I doubt Disney will ever release it here. The cassette is unopened and has original shrink-wrap. A must-have for Disney fans and collectors!!! The tape is in the European PAL format so it will not be viewable on US "NTSC" VCR'S. It will have to be converted to U.S. standard of NTSC. You can probably find a local video shop in your area that will convert it for $20-$30. If not there are mail order places that will do it for you in that same price range. Winning bidder pays $8.00 for Priority Mail Shipping Handling &amp; Insurance. Money orders, Cashiers checks or PayPal ONLY. Payment is due within 10 days after the close of the auction. Please e-mail me with any questions. Please, only serious bidders. Check out my feedback to see how GOOD I really am. Good luck and have a Zip-A-De-Do-Dah day.

    <Description>FATHERS' DAY, WS, AC-3 - LD Description " Two of the screen's most popular comic actors meet in this movie about two men brought together by unexpected circumstances. On the surface, Jack Lawrence (Billy Crystal) and Dale Putley (Robin Williams) wouldn't appear to have much in common. Jack is an efficient, serious-minded lawyer with a successful practice and a beautiful wife, Carrie (Julia-Louis Dreyfus). Dale is a very single performance artist given to dramatic mood swings and extreme overreaction to the sad state of his career. However, 17 years ago both men were involved with the same woman, Collette Andrews (Nastassja Kinski); she later had a son, Scott (Charlie Hofheimer), without being sure if Jack or Dale was actually the father. Collette chose to raise the boy on her own, but when Scott runs away from home and she can't track him down, she calls both Jack and Dale looking for help. It doesn't take long for the two men to discover that they're both looking for the same boy in the same places, and they decide to join forces, though their personalities don't get much more compatible the longer they hunt for Scott. Keep an eye peeled for a brief cameo by Mel Gibson and an appearance by the rock band Sugar Ray, shortly before their commercial breakthrough" Payment and Shipping Info Payment Options Credit Card, Money Order / Cashier's Check, Personal Check Shipping/Handling Rate $5.00 Insurance Rate $1.10 Shipping Options See Item Description Sales Tax 6.5% for in-state buyers / 0% for out-of-state buyers Terms View My Other Auctions Visit MURZICK today!

RETAILS FOR $19.99 Intriguing Tony Bill-directed film, based on a quirky screenplay by playwright John Patrick Shanley. Set in the Bronx in the early 1960s, Five Corners deals with the effects of the release from prison of the neighborhood psycho (John Turturro), who is free to once again stalk the woman of his dreams (Jodie Foster). Her boyfriend (Todd Graff) is crippled and can't save her. The neighborhood tough guy who did rescue her last time (Tim Robbins) has decided to become a nonviolent pacifist working for civil rights and refuses to lift his hand in violence. A strange, fascinating mix, including several set pieces that come out of nowhere to energize an already edgy story. U.S. BUYER PAYS $3.00 SHIPPING AND HANDLING. INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING IS $4.50.

Somebody hears something they love, and they play it their own way. It_s a sort of Chinese whisper. Just as Bob Dylan_s _With God On Our Side_ has a very Irish melody with very American content, the same song on The Neville Brother_s Yellow Moon is transformed from pure-form folk to moody space age. Film maker Philip King and Lanois met while working in Ireland on U2_s Actung Baby album. King takes you on a journey through some of LANOIS' production work with U2, Bob Dylan, Peter Gabriel, The Neville Brothers and the making of LANOIS'S "For The Beauty of Wynonna" CD. This item is what Lanois calls a _series of musical snapshots that we pulled together during a six month adventure._ This item is no longer commercially available, and is OUT OF PRINT. Music performed including: Elle Est Bonne Et Belle/O Marie/Le Petit Cordonier- w/ Roland and Real Charette/Indian Red-w/ Daryl Johnson, and Bill Dillon/With God On Our Side-w/Aaron Neville/Series Of Dreams w/Bob Dylan/ The Collection of Marie Claire/Fisherman_s Daughter Instrumental/ I Still Haven_t Found What I_m Looking For w/U2/The Messenger/Come Talk To Me w/Peter Gabriel/Need Somebody/Bother LA w/ Daryl Johnson and Ronald Jones/For The Beauty Of Wynona/Waiting/Rocky World This item is a previously pre-viewed video (PPV), and is in like new condition, with very good to excellent viewing quality.

    <Description>"As hard as it is to imagine, some Ren &amp; Stimpy episodes were judged too violent, inhumane, and subversive to be displayed on Nickelodeon. These episodes were either severely edited and redrawn or canned entirely. This tape includes one complete episode that never aired on any TV station, as well as the original, unedited versions of several other episodes. Meet the original forms of many Ren &amp; Stimpy characters such as George Liquor (who returns in much mellower form in 'The Dog Show') who was so 'sick and disgusting' that Nickelodeon returned his rights to Spumco." FOR TRUE REN &amp; STIMPY FANS ONLY!! That's right!! Winning bidder of this auction receives 1 hour and 47 minutes of Rare and Uncensored Ren &amp; Stimpy, all on one non-labeled VHS cassette which comes nicely packaged in a clamshell case with full-color sleeve!! The episode entitled "Man's Best Friend," has to be seen to be believed.. A VERY violent (and hilarious) cartoon. Also included are many episodes you may have seen before, but these contain scenes which were cut from the "Nick" versions (plus some pencil tests, etc).. **Picture/audio quality ranges from about 6 out of 10 (decent) at it's best, to about 4 out of 10 (poor) at it's worst - but that's standard for episodes of this rarity. This tape comes from a comic convention, and the contents were never offered on a commerical (ie. store-bought) VHS tape. KNOW WHAT YOU ARE BIDDING ON!! - To avoid any misunderstandings, please feel free to email me with any questions. Shipping will be $3.50 priority mail, and I accept money orders and Paypal. NO international orders.. Will ship to United States only!!! Payment must be received within 8 days of auction's close - Deadbeat bidders will receive some nasty feedback. Good luck and thanx for looking!!</Description>

    <Description>Nausicaa From the Hayao Miyazaki Ghibli Collection. Must have for any Miyazaki Ghibli Fans. Movie is In Original Japanese Dialogue with English Subtitles on VHS. Shipping is $5.00 US Story Synopsis It has been a millennium since a global war known as the "Seven Days of Fire" destroyed human civilization. Only a tiny remnant of humanity survives, huddled in small enclaves across the continents. The Fukai, a thick jungle whose spores and plantlife are poisonous to humans, covers much of the Earth $B!#%L (Bs surface. Feeding on the pollutants of the former human civilization, the Fukai continues to expand, enveloping the outposts of mankind and consuming them. Giant mutated insects are now the dominant form of life, living both in and above the Fukai. Of these, the Ohmu reign supreme -- seventy-meter long pillbug-shaped guardians of the Fukai. One of these islands of humanity is known as the Valley of the Wind. Protected from the spores by strong winds from the sea, these winds also power a forest of windmills to perform work and pump water from underground wells. Nonetheless, the inhabitants of the Valley must still be vigilant to ensure that the fungi do not gain a foothold amongst their crops and water supply. This story follows Nausicaa, the headstrong yet kindhearted princess of the Valley of Wind, as she strives to understand the mysteries of the Fukai and protect her Valley in the midst of this war-torn world.

We expect payment in 10 days but many of our bidders wait for other of our auctions (which you really should look at! ) to close so we (and they ) can save shipping dollars. We DO ask that you respond in 3 days to our email so we know you are alive (if you were abducted by aliens, we'll allow another 24 hours but we may want a validated photo of the inside of the "mother ship" ). We are normally VERY FAST at sending you an email immediately after the auction closes. If you do not respond to our email in 7 days, you have VOIDED the sale and a Non-Paying Bidder report will be filed with eBay If you don't receive our email - which many people like but some people think is too long and "wordy" - (actually, as is this "small print section") - within 12 hours after an auction closes, EMAIL us! Please do not use Ebay's checkout to contact us unless all else fails. eBay will not allow us to "opt out" of Checkout but we do not use it since it will slow down processing of YOUR ORDER. You will receive an email directly from us which will have your total , combined shipping info, and payment options. CLICK TO SEE MORE GREAT DEALS! SAVE SHIPPING!

    <Description>We appreciate your viewing of this item. We sell tons of games &amp; systems on line. We also sell DVDS. All of our games are bought from gamers just like you! Usually, all games come in a jewel case with instructions. All games ARE ORIGINAL games. No CDR copies or burned games are sold through ebay_.it is illegal. If the game comes with a box or is brand new, it will be EXPLICITLY stated in the auction title. Most games are in mint condition. All game systems are in great condition as well. We have multiple quantities of each item, sometimes only one, but usually more than one. Therefore, the picture scanned below is not often the same as the one you will receive. But it is fairly close! We do not have a lot of time to answer e-mail. E-mails about specific products are welcome, but they may not be answered if time constraints do not permit us. DO NOT contact us after the auction ends; our auctionwatch service will automatically send you an e-mail after the auction ends telling you where to send payment &amp; how much to add for S&amp;H. WE DO accept paypal. PLEASE include the game, system or DVD title with your payment. Since we sell so many things on-line, it is hard to keep track of payments if they are not referenced. Once the auction has ended, Paypal will notify you where to send payment (whether or not YOU use paypal). Sometimes their service is erratic; if you do not receive notification within 48 hrs, please contact us and we will notify you where to send payment. Please contact us before leaving irrational negative feedback; doing so will result in your own negative feedback</Description>

    <Description>RETAILS $29.99-The perverted geniuses at Seduction Cinema present this twist on the sword &amp; sandal epic, using Ridley Scott's phenomenally successful GLADIATOR as a model. Set in the year 285 A.D., the film finds the beautiful lesbian Roman General Eroticvs celebrating her latest victory, one made possible by her body weakening seduction of the foe. Soon, Eroticvs finds herself in the middle of a dispute between Emperor Gluteus Maximus and his son Dickus Minimus and, feared by the cowardly Dickus, quickly ends up as an excommunicated slave. However, Eroticvs vows revenge and rises among the ranks of nude lesbian gladiators to the top, putting her in a position to exact her revenge by taking advantage of the lusty Roman leaders.

NTSC. This is it. The original and classic first Godzilla film released in Japan in 1954 titled Gojira. The film was released in the U.S. in 1956 as Godzilla King Of The Monsters. This version had more than 20 minutes cut out and new footage was inserted starring Raymond Burr as reporter !Steve Martin!. Although, that version is familiar to most and is a classic in itself it cannot compare to the much more somber and excellently crafted Japanese Original. This tape has been never available in the U.S. and is a must for any Godzilla collector. The film is in its original Japanese language with English with easy to read English Subtitles. Also included after the feature is the original Japanese theatrical trailer. Don't miss this opportunity to add the first and best Godzilla film to your collection.

    <Description>Beast Haunted Cave/Brain That Wouldnt Die DVD Brand new sealed dvd! In the late 1950's and 1960's a motley crew of independent film producers pumped up double bills with sinister mayhem and horror. Whether the venue was a run-down movie palace, a musty neighborhood theatre or a drive-in under the stars, kids, teenagers on dates, and outcasts found themselves receptive to the promise of witnessing the unveiling of macabre secrets, nearly forbidden, it seemed, because of the bloody gruesomeness of lascivious sexuality hinted at by the colorful posters and ballyhoo. For the young, horror films were a psychic, if bizarre glimpse into the still-mysterious world of adulthood; for the rest of the audience, these films provided a jolting break from the predictable and the mundane. Beast From Haunted Cave Released: 1959 Director: Monte Hellman Cast: Michael Forest, Sheila Carol, Frank Wolff, Richard Sinatra, Wally Campo Running Time: 75 mins. Gold thieves hiding in a wilderness cabin encounter a spider-like monster. The Beast from Haunted Cave owes its existence to a World War II action film about German Paratroopers. Producer/ Director Roger Corman was making plans to film Ski Troop Attack in the winter wonderland of the Black Hills of South Dakota and, in order to get the most product bang out of his limited budget buck, decided to produce with brother Gene, another film at the same time, utilizing much of the same cast and crew. Screenwriter Chuck Griffith received an assignment from Corman to come up with a scrip that copied their previous Naked Paradise (1957), this time substituting a blizzard for a storm. Corman added: "Oh, and add a monster." The Brain That Wouldn't Die Released: 1962 Director: Joseph Green Cast: Jason Evers, Virginia Leith, Leslie Daniels, Adele Lamont Running Time: 82 mins. A brilliant surgeon keeps the decapitated head of his fianc e alive after an auto accident while he searches for a suitably stacked body into which to transplant the head. Thirteen days is all it took director Joseph Green to make this wild and sleazy tale that became an undisputed cult classic that no true lover of trash cinema can afford to miss. Special Features: &amp;#149 Animated Menus &amp;#149 Theatrical Trailer of Other Killer Creature Titles &amp;#149 Theatrical Trailer of Feature Presentation &amp;#149 Feature Presentation &amp;#149 Intermission (Cartoon) &amp;#149 Theatrical Trailer of 2nd Feature Presentation &amp;#149 Second Feature Presentation No region coding, should play on any dvd player!

    <Description>Anne of Green Gables VHS 6 Tape Boxed Collection NEW, Factory Sealed. This item is obtained directly from our authorized wholesale distributor. It is new and unopened, in the original factory shrink wrap. Anne of Green Gables Complete 6 VHS Set Starring: Megan Follows Jonathan Crombie Colleen Dewhurst Rated: Not Rated Running Time: 630 minutes total NTSC format (US and Canada only) Color, 3 Box sets, NTSC Number of tapes: 6 Anne of Green Gables Kevin Sullivan's "Anne of Green Gables" is the definitive screen adaptation of L.M. Montgomery's Victorian era novel about a spirited red-headed orphan and her adventures on Prince Edward Island. In this first installment of three, Anne Shirley arrives in Avonlea and soon finds a home with an elderly brother and sister, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert. Before long, she discovers a bosom friend in Diana Barry and a rival in Gilbert Blythe. This is the definitive version of the beloved children's book, with flawless performances by Megan Follows, Colleen Dewhurst, Richard Farnsworth and Jonathan Crombie; a heart-stirring soundtrack; and an engaging plot that will delight children and adults alike! The perfect family-friendly movie for all generations. Anne of Green Gables: Anne of Avonlea Released in 1987, Kevin Sullivan's "Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel" (also known as "Anne of Avonlea") is a worthy adaptation of Lucy Maud Montgomery's novel, Anne of Avonlea, continuing where the first installment, "Anne of Green Gables" ends. In this sequel, Anne Shirley leaves Avonlea to become a schoolteacher at a ladies college, after Diana Barry's marriage and Gilbert Blythe's departure for medical school. While at the school, Anne faces a number of challenges from a weathy family of Pringles, a stern principal determined to sour Anne's cheerful outlook on life, as well as a proposal from a dashing Morgan Harris! This is a rare sequel that rivals the humor, emotion, and elegance of its predecessor. Megan Follows returns to her memorable role as Anne, while Colleen Dewhurst (Marilla Cuthbert), Jonathan Crombie (Gilbert Blythe) and Schuyler Grant (Diana Barry) reprise their familiar characters. Oscar-winning actress Dame Wendy Hiller appears as the prickly Mrs. Harris, matriarch of the Pringle clan. Anne of Green Gables: The Continuing Story Sullivan Entertainment's final installment of the "Anne of Green Gables" trilogy is loosely based on the characters and setting from L.M. Montgomery's novels. In the concluding installment, Megan Follows returns in her memorable role of Anne Shirley. Now grown up, Anne and her fiance, Gilbert Blythe (Jonathan Crombie), return to Avonlea for the first time since Marilla Cuthbert's death. After visiting Diana Barry (Schuyler Grant) and a host of familiar characters from the first two miniseries, Gilbert persuades Anne to join him in New York City, where he will begin his medical tenure. Hoping to become a published writer, Anne joins a publishing firm and there meets a dashing yet arrogant novelist, Jack Garrison. After Gilbert and Anne face the disillusioning realities of their professions, they decide to return to Avonlea and finally get married. Their happiness is short-lived, however, when Gilbert enlists to serve in the first World War in Europe. After a series of harrowing events, including a chance encounter with Jack, Anne embarks on a journey that takes her through the horrors of war to find her true love, Gilbert.

    <Description>PRE-ORDER TITLE. DVD IS BRAND NEW, IN STOCK AND READY TO SHIP: Jan. 10th. The Release Date is: Jan 15th. BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. The Complete 1st Season. ***THIS IS IT! FINALLY, THE NORTH AMERICAN RELEASE!!!! Edition Details: _ Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only) _ Color, Dolby, Box set _ Commentary by Joss Whedon on episodes 1 and 2 _ Theatrical trailer(s) _ 12 Episodes on 3 discs _ Interview with Joss Whedon and David Boreanaz _ Original pilot episode script _ Photo gallery _ Full-screen format _ Number of discs: 3 Buffy Summers (Sarah Michelle Gellar) looks like your typical perky high-schooler, and like most, she has her secret fears and anxieties. However, while most teens are worrying about their next date, their next zit, or their next term paper, Buffy's angsting over the next vampire she has to slay. See, Buffy, a young woman with superhuman strength, is the "chosen one," and she must help rid the world of evil, namely by staking demons. The exceptional first season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer introduces us to the treacherous world of Sunnydale High School (where Buffy moved after torching her previous high school's gym). The characters there include "watcher" Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) and the original "Scooby Gang" members--friendly geek Xander (Nicholas Brendon), computer whiz Willow (Alyson Hannigan), and snobbish popular girl Cordelia (Charisma Carpenter)--who aid Buffy in her quest. Those used to the darker tone that Buffy took in its later seasons will be surprised by the lighter feeling these first 12 episodes have--it's kind of like Buffy 90210 as the cast grapples with regular teen problems in addition to saving the world from demonic darkness. Fans of the show will enjoy the crisp writing, the phenomenal chemistry of the cast (already well-established within the first few episodes), and the introduction to characters that would stay for many seasons, including moody vampire Angel (David Boreanaz). Through it all, Gellar carries the series with amazing confidence, whether conveying the despair of high school or dispatching various demons--she's one of TV's most distinctive and strongest heroines.

    <Description>From the season 5 episode "Motherhood", Xena has had the ultimate showdown with the Greek gods and goddesses, in defense of Eve, and has killed most of them. She has allowed Ares to live as thanks for his saving the lives of Gabrielle and Eve (and, I suspect, also due to a certain SOFT spot in her heart!!). In this excellent image, she is thanking him and he, being Ares, is making one more pitch for her love! Great addition to any Xena memorabilia collection! I accept money orders and PayPal. Buyer pays $3.50 Priority shipping ($1.10 additional for insurance if desired). International buyers please email for shipping charges. BID ON!!!

Trade Ads are placed in LIMITED CIRCULATION HOLLYWOOD TRADE PUBLICATIONS targeted directly to the audience that votes on the Oscars and Emmys (Stars, Directors, Producers, Studio Heads, Cinematographers, etc.).

Directed by Stanley Kubrick. "Safe in their picturesque chateau behind the front lines, the French General Staff passes down a direct order to Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas): take the Ant Hill at any cost. A blatant suicide mission, the attack is doomed to failure. Covering up their fatal blunder, the Generals order the arrest of three innocent soldiers, charging them with cowardice and mutiny. Dax, a lawyer in civilian life, rises to the men's defense but soon realizes that unless he can prove that the Generals were to blame, nothing less than a miracle will save his clients from the firing squad."

    <Description>Three-time Emmy Award winner Beau Bridges stars as the colorful Phineas Taylor Barnum in this 1999 landmark A&amp;E and Hallmark Entertainment original movie. The life of the "Greatest Showman on Earth" is chronicled from his humble beginnings as a young man who managed an old woman who was supposedly George Washington's nursemaid, his success promoting curiousities and attractions when he buys what was essentially a museum of oddities and frauds, and his transformation of a one-ring juggling act into the three-ring spectacle that continues to enchant audiences today...as will this entertaining and exuberant 2 VHS movie which has never been played and is factory shrink wrapped (NOT previously viewed and rewrapped in the original boxes with a "same as new appearance"). Buyer agrees to pay $5.00 priority shipping and handling (or $2.50 media rate) within the United States; international rates vary. Good luck and have fun bidding on this dazzling dramatized biography of P.T. BARNUM whose own life was at times more thrilling than anything he ever presented under the big top!

    <Description>******ALL PHOTOS ARE 8X10_S.****** Hi everyone, this is Amy from EBAY POWERSELLER CELEBSIGN, I created this account 2nd account to sell strictly preprints to help myself stay more organized. I run up to 400 items per week and by splitting up my items I will be better able to serve you. You will receive your items quicker by allowing me to split the work of processing orders among my partners. Theses preprints are among the best quality I have ever seen and are exact replicas of the original Hand Signed Versions that I have in my display cases covering the walls of my home and office space. Many of these original photos are worth over $100.00 and here you can have an exact replica for a fraction of the cost. I promise 99.9% of the people who receive these photos have a very very very hard time telling the difference from the original hand signed one. These things are so damn good that even I can barely tell the difference from the originals when they are both in my hand, and when they are hanging onm the wall in a picture frame it is virtually impossible. These replicas are wonderful for bars, restaurants, club houses, ect where theft is a possibility. Customers will think they are real and it one gets stolen or damaged it not like your out hundreds of dollars. Shipping is $2.00 no matter how many you buy!!! $5.00 outside USA. I CAN ONLY TAKE MONEY ORDERS, CASH, OR PAYPALL FOR THIS ACCOUNT, NO CHECKS!!!!! MY PAYPALL ACCOUNT IS EBAY7380@AOL.COM</Description>

    <Description>Untitled Document Stealing Home on DVD (brand new) This DVD is brand new and still sealed in the factory shrink wrapping. "It fires the imagination and touches the heart"- Rex Reed "At the Movies" This movie stars: Academy Award Winner Jodie Foster Mark Harmon Blair Brown Jonathan Silverman Harold ramis William McNamara John Shea Directed by Steven Kampmann Synopsis: For ex-ballplayer Mark Harmon, whose drive never matched his big league prospects, the high point of his life was summer of 64'. Decades later, He returns home to recall the past - and the person who made it special (Jody Foster). Harmon and Foster star in Stealing Home , a bittersweet story "beautifully written a la Moonstruck " in which "you'll spend a couple of hours lost in a wonderful world." As a burnout seeking redemption, Chicago Hope's Harmon hits the mark as the older Billy, and the luminous Foster sparkles as Kate, the friend and mentor who vibrantly draws the loose end of Billy's past and present together. Buoyed by a marvelous golden-oldies soundtrack, Stealing Home is a warm, wistful memory-lane journey. Special features and Info: Standard Version Interactive Menus Scene Access Subtitles and Languages: English and French Dolby Digital SHIPPING AND PAYMENT TERMS: Winning bidder agrees to pay shipping and handling. Insurance is extra and to be borner by buyer. I accept money order, cashier's check, and Paypal. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>VALLEY GIRL-VHS OOP NICHOLAS CAGE BRAND NEW BRAND NEW SEALED!!! It's a "totally tubular" scene as a "grody-to-the-max" punk from the wrong side of the Hollywood Hills, Randy (Nicolas Cage), falls for Julie (Deborah Foreman), a mall dwelling Valley Girl, in this time capsule of 1980s teen vernacular. Julie and Randy become passionately involved; yet, despite her feelings for Randy, Julie succumbs to the peer pressure of her mall obsessed friends, and gets back together with her Valley dude boyfriend, Tommy (Michael Bowen), who whisks Julie off to the Senior prom. Randy doesn't give up so easily, however, and chases Julie to the prom, with the help of his faithful friend, Fred (Cameron Dye), in an attempt to wrest her back. The sound track features the music of Men at Work, The Clash, and Josie Cotton in this 1980s teen comedy--an era, and topic, that director Coolidge was fond of chronicling, like her contemporary, John Hughes. sHIPPIN $4.00 pRIORITY MAIL Click Here!

    <Description>MUMMIES ALIVE! DIC 5 Complete Episodes DVD Twelve-year-old Presley is the unknowing reincarnation of a murdered Egyptian prince. Coincidentally, his mom works at a San Francisco museum hosting a mummy exhibit, which allows his centuries-old archenemy Scarab and his four guardians to contact him. The writers combine pun-filled humor and action. They have fun with the culture shock experienced by the mummies-come-to-life (the TV is a "spirit box," a car is a "swift chariot"), as well as the requisite centerpiece battle in each episode. Presley, his four preserved protectors (including girl warrior Nefer-Tina voiced by the ubiquitous Cree Summer), and a mummified cat share a pleasant camaraderie, while the villains are predictably depraved. It all makes for great fun for children ages 5 and up. DVD Features: 5 Complete Episodes Exciting Interactive Game Interview w/Ivan Reitman English and Spanish Language Track Trailers English Subtitles 1998, 103 minutes.

    <Description>NUNSENSE**1 &amp; 2**2 VHS**Rue McClanahan**NEW** Description This is a brand new factory sealed 2 VHS set! I never deal in Bootlegs or Screeners! NTSC format for play in USA and Canada. Description Nunsense Join a live audience to watch the Little Sisters of Hoboken display their divine talents in a zany benefit revue. In an effort to raise money for their fallen Sisters--unfortunate victims of a convent cooking accident--Mother Superior (The Golden Girls' Rue McClanahan) and her order of eccentric and endearing nuns show the lighter side of being Catholic. With riotous dance numbers, show-stopping songs and side-splitting wit, you'll swear Nunsense was heaven-sent! This video of the long-running hit musical features scenes not included in the television broadcast. Rue McClanahan, Christine Anderson, Semina De Laurentis, Christine Toy. 112 minutes. Nunsense 2 Emmy Award-winner Rue McClanahan (The Golden Girls) reprises her role as Mother Superior in the continuation of the trials and tribulations of the Little Sisters of Hoboken. Join the madcap Sisters--who have been bitten by the "theater flea" and are now just a bit slicker--as they give a thank you performance for all those who supported their first benefit. But of course, in the middle of their show, chaos erupts! First, the Franciscans come to claim Sister Mary Amnesia, winner of the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes, as one of their own. Then, the nuns learn there is a talent scout in the audience who wants to see them strut their stuff. With hilarious musical humor and enough laughs to make you cry, America's favorite nuns have outdone themselves in Nunsense 2: The Sequel. Terri White, Rue McClanahan, Christine Anderson, Semina De Laurentis, Christine Toy. 109 minutes.

    <Description>CALLE 54*Sub-Titled*WideScreen*DVD*Trueba*NEW Description This DVD is brand-new and factory-sealed! In Calle 54, Madrid-based filmmaker Fernando Trueba explores the wide and wonderful world of Latin jazz: a hybrid genre that fuses the clave, samba, flamenco, meringue, and other rhythms from Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Americas. The film's Spanish title takes its name from Sony Music Studios located on 54th Street in Manhattan, where a who's who of musicians were filmed and recorded. They range from Brazilian bombshell keyboardist Eliane Elias and enigmatic Argentine tenor saxophonist Gato Barbieri, to the fiery rumba group Puntilla y Nueva Generacion. The music and musicians of Cuba and Puerto Rico dominate this documentary, and the most touching scene is the emotional father-and-son reunion of Cuban pianists Bebo and Chucho Vald s, who were separated by Fidel Castro's revolution. Sadly, the film features the last onscreen appearances by the late composer-arranger Chico O'Farrill and the legendary timbales master Tito Puente. Simply put, Calle 54 is a documentary that dances. Edition Details: Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only) Color, Closed-captioned, Widescreen Commentary by associate producer and Latin jazz historian Nat Chediak Theatrical trailer(s) Calle 54: Side B: documentary on the history of Latin jazz (1 hr.)

    <Description>Items matching (menudo) "Una Aventura Llamada Menudo" The video has been out of print for a long time! We bought several of these down in Mexico a long time ago, before the 1983 earthquake. This video is one of the original ones purchased and its original quality is intact . The scans of this video (below) are being provided to show how great it really is! Xavier, Miguel, Johnny, Ricky and Charlie sing, dance, and are seen only in their BATHING SUITS several times ! The story is about the group who rode in a balloon in order to get to their next concert destination, but get trapped at a house where some girls fall in love with them. You will see them and the girls playing in and around the swimming pool and playing on the beach. Johnny falls in love with a blonde-haired girl named Clara. And after singing the great song "Senora Mia" to Clara's mean aunt, they are allowed to go sing at their concert. This is a Spanish language video from the early '80's and was bought in Mexico. It was made and sold in Latin America, not the U.S. It lasts about 85 minutes and the music is as wonderful as the movie; you will be wanting to buy the CD if you don't already own it! The video comes in a clear plastic protective storage case (that I bought it in) to protect it from dust and damage, so it will stay in top quality condition for years to come. The protective case replaces any cover box, so the scans below are only being provided to show you what the tape is about. Since no refunds are issued, due to the possibility of the product being copied by a dishonest bidder after purchase, please email abraceme@netzero.net if there are any questions, prior to bidding. This is a great product. Click on the number next to my user name (upper left, under Seller Info) to see the positive feedback ratings from satisfied customers! If you're a Menudo fan, you will definitely love this, and you're friends will love watching it with you. These are the songs that are in the video: Cambiale Las Pilas Tu te Imaginas Coqui Lluvia La Estrella Polar Senora Mia Dame Un Beso Clara Claridad If you check my feedback , you'll see that all products that I sell are just as great as I advertise!

    <Description>Jerry Springer - Too Hot for TV (1997) If you thought the "The Jerry Springer Show" was a three-ring circus, you haven't seen the outtakes! That's right--it's a parade of feuding and fussing families, outrageous exotic dancers, and the dirtiest laundry the talk-show circuit has to offer. Buyer prepays price of movie plus $4.00 shipping and handling via USPS 1st class rate. Payment can be made by check, money order, or by credit card through Paypal. Payment must be made within 10 days of the close of the auction. Please view my other movies on auction and save on shipping. I list hundreds of movies every week. So that you may want to make many purchases I have lowered my shipping charges for multiple purchases. I charge $4.00 for the first movie, $2.00 for the second, and $1.00 for each additional movie. I allow seven days between the close of the first auction and the last. I highly recommend that insurance be purchased for videos shipped in the United States. I cannot and will not be held responsible for movies lost or damaged in the mail. Insurance only costs $1.10 to insure the delivery. If living outside the U.S. postage will be higher and the cost will be confirmed after the auction has closed. International orders cannot be insured. The costs are quite high to do this. All of our movies are previously viewed unless otherwise indicated. The picture depicted is not necessarily the one that is available due to the fact that some movies have various sleeves. Please do not bid if you do not intend to purchase. A $20 dollar service charge will be assessed for bad checks.

And that's Robert Downey Jr. as one of the in-crowd jerks who makes nerds Mitchell-Smith and Hall's lives miserable. Fortunately, this is a John Hughes comedy and our smart nerds create the perfect woman, Lisa (Kelly LeBrock), using a computer and voodoo. Lisa is a willing sex toy, has magical powers, and just wants to help the boys get even and meet nice babes. She even cleans up. The fantasy ebullience of Hughes is given full rein here and that's good and bad (mostly good). It's all aimed at a certain kind of hormone-addled, 16-year-old sensibility; but who doesn't have a little bit of that in them? Edition Details: Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only) Color, Closed-captioned, Dolby, Widescreen Widescreen letterbox format The DVD is 100% new and still shrinkwrapped.

    <Description>The Full Monty Widescreen VHS Robert Carlyle Click picture to enlarge Description: Description: A group of unemployed Yorkshire steelworkers hopes to replenish their empty wallets and boost their flagging morale by following in the footsteps of the Chippendale's strippers. These guys are hardly what you would think of as buff, and few can even dance. They simply take these problems in stride, because these are men with a plan--displaced, unemployed, and feeling suffocated by the women in their lives, they just want to earn a little respect. The dialogue and interaction between these men will have you screeching with laughter, but of equal importance is their sense of camaraderie and caring. First-time director Peter Cattaneo is a name to watch for; he easily conveys the sheer humanity of these people in their small town with their sad stories and irresistible sense of optimism.

    <Description>Clippings Victor Alfieri Days of Our Lives I am sorry the picture isn't that good. All clippings are shown are included in this set of clippings. There are approximately 25 clippings in these sets. The clippings are in great to excellence condition. They range from small to large photo in color and black and white. Some of the articles may be missing a page. I have taken them from many different soap magazines including Soap Opera Digest, Update, Weekly, News, Soap World, TV Soap, Soaps in Depth and many many more. The years range from 88 to present time mostly covering 97-20. I have a ton of clippings to put up. If there is a certain show or actor you are interested in please let me know and I will get a clipping package of them up on Ebay right away. Check out my other auctions to save on shipping. Buyer pays $4.00 for priority shipping or 2.00 for standard mail. For international shipping the cost will be higher and payment CAN ONLY be made via an online service or cash if you are overseas or from Canada. I ship items only on mondays and some Fridays. Please note that the total item cost DOES NOT include the shipping. Shipping is above and beyond the total. I've had too many people recently not pay for shipping so I feel I must put this in here. If I receive payment without shipping I will not send the item until the shipping money has been received or I will leave negative feedback for you. Unfortunately due to many non-bidders I feel I need to add this in here. If you do not respond to me within 20 days after auction end then I will leave negative feedback and report it with Ebay and a non-payment. So please do not bid if you do not intend to pay. If you have any questions ask before you bid. I have just made a homepage that has a list of Days Of Our Lives tapes.

    <Description>Thank you for looking at my auction. This ad is vintage NOT a copy. starring your favorite Hollywood Movie Star. It averages 10"x15". And is in perfect condition. Great for matting and framing. If it looks cut off it is because my scanner is a little smaller that the ad itself.

I prefer paypal however, I accept billpoint, bidpay, checks, money orders and cash at sender's own risk. If you purchase more than one item I will of course combine shipping for you.

    <Description>Back to the Future Part I II III BODY { scrollbar-base-color:gray; scrollbar-arrow-color: black; scrollbar-DarkShadow-Color:black; } VHS Back to the Future Part I II III Back to the Future Part I II III This is one of my favorite movies. Michael J. Fox plays Marty McFly, who accidentally gets sent back in time from 1985 to 1955 in a time machine that also happens to be a DeLorean automobile. The problem is to get enough of an electrical charge to get back to 1985, while leaving 1955 as it was. In the process, Marty meets his parents, jeopardizes their relationship, and risks his own existance. Marty McFly is the part Fox was born to play, but there are other great performances here, as well. Christopher Lloyd is excellent as "Doc" Brown, and Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas Wilson also help to make this a very entertaining movie. There is an extra attraction here for those of us who can remember the 1950's, and some of the gags based on Fox's out-of-time character are classic. Check out Marty playing "Johnnie B. Goode" as a bandmember holds up the phone so his "cousin", Chuck Berry, can listen and learn. This is not the cleverest or most sophisticated comedy around, but it is definitely great fun. I've watched it many times and expect to watch it many more. If you haven't got a copy, try to pick one up. You won't be sorry. II Like most of us I viewed Part 1, Part ll, and Part lll, each several months apart. Each movie was good in its own right. It wasn't until I sat down with all three films and watched them together, in order, that the true genius of the writing presented itself with about twenty five million jigawatts of fun and excitement. Of all three installments, Part ll is the most entertaining and spellbinding. For a fantasy this is about the best I've seen since the creation of Superman. It is not one single element of the film or the trilogy that make Back To The Future, a new twist on H.G. Wells The Time Machine. The surround sound is certainly out of this world. The special effects are second to none. Some may think this is a science fiction movie, and it is, but more then science fiction, Back To The Future is a love story about Marty McFly and his girlfriend, Jennifer, make no mistake about it. When you add the element of love to the comedic mix, special effects, and wonderful video production techniques, you have a spellbinding combination. The technique of going thirty years into the past and thirty years into the future allows the writer to capture sixty years of events in a format where the viewer is forced to examine how events in 1955 shape and change events in 1985 as well as 2015. In 1985 it was the Lybian terrorists, in 2001 it is Osama bin Laben and the Al-Queda terrorists. Sixteen years in the future and audiances can easily relate to the storyline. I urge those with a flair and yearning for a romantic comedy which is never going to be dated, to buy their own copy of Back To The Future, Part ll, as well as the two other movies in the trilogy. View them in order and you too will be saying, "Doc, we don't have enough road to get up to 88!" To which Doc Brown replies, "Roads, where we're going, we don't need roads." Music up as the DeLorean zooms accross the screen in route, Back To The Future. See you in the future, I mean, the past, I mean, I concure with the words of Doc Brown, "The future is not yet written, so make it a good one!" But that line is from Part lll. III If there's any movie series I really love, it's the "Back to the Future" trilogy. In the original film, Marty McFly travels thirty years into the past (1955) where he tries to warn Doc of being murdered in the future, but his teenage mother-to-be falls in love with him instead of his father. In the first sequel, Marty and Doc went into Marty's future. And in the final episode, Marty travels back to the Wild West to prevent western cowboy Biff from murdering Doc. The series takes on a new charm with the romance between Doc and a schoolteacher he saves the life of, played by Mary Steenburgen. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd star.

    <Description>Thank you for visiting our auctions! This auction is for two brand new factory sealed The Beverly Hillbillies dvd. This would make a fantastic Christmas present for any classic tv show fan! Each dvd contains two episodes, so there are 4 classic episodes in all. This is a list of the four titles: Jethros First Love The Great Feud The Clampetts Meet the Dodgers The Great Feud These dvds also contain Beverly Hillbillies Trivia, Hillbilly Lingo, Grannys Favorite Vittles, Direct Scene Access and Jeds Bio. About The Beverly Hillbillies One of CBS' longest - running situation comedies, this was the slapstick treatment of the Clampetts, an Ozark hillbilly family who struck it rich (an oil well sprouted in their front yard) and moved to a Beverly Hills mansion. They deposited the $25 million given to them by John Brewster, of the OK Oil Company, for drilling rights to their land, in Milburn Drysdale's Commerce Banks. As Drysdale's biggest depositors, they received special treatment. The banker, concerned about their naivete and ignorance of "big city ways," moved them into the mansion next door to his own home, in hopes of keeping an eye on them and helping them become more civilized.

    <Description>WEIRD SCIENCE - DVD - NEW - OUT OF PRINT WEIRD SCIENCE - DVD - *** NEW *** - OUT OF PRINT The Frankenstein legend takes an uproarious twist in this outrageous special effects-laden comedy from the writer-director of Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club. Critically acclaimed filmmaker John Hughes is at it again, giving nerdy computer whiz, Ilan Mitchell-Smith and best friend, Anthony Michael Hall, power to create the perfect woman (the tantalizing Kelly LeBrock). Like a computer generated fairy godmother, the duos out-of-this-world creation guides the pair through the pleasures and pitfalls of adolescence. With a rock beat supplied by many music superstars including Oingo Boingo, this far-out sci-fi fable brings everyone's favorite teen fantasies to life through the miracle of Weird Science.

BILLPOINT OR PAYPAL PERFERRED WILL SHIP WITHIN 24 HRS. IF YOU USE THIS OPTION. Director Ron Howard casts comedian Jim Carrey in the title role in this live-action adaptation of the famous Christmas tale by Dr. Seuss, giving this rendition of HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS a delightfully manic spin. Carrey is virtually unrecognizable in his elaborate green makeup, but his anarchic comic touch is unmistakable. He manages to fully embody the grumpy title character, while still supplying his own comedic touches, and it is his performance that makes the film a treat for adults and children alike. The candy-colored set design for the town of Whoville and the jubilant score contribute to the overall feeling of innocuous fantasy that the Grinch disrupts with his dastardly deeds. The familiar story of the Grinch stealing every present in town on Christmas Eve has been expanded to incorporate flashbacks to the Grinch's childhood, which serve to explain his hostility toward the Whos. As Cindy Lou-Who, a little girl so sweet she sees goodness even in the Grinch, young Taylor Momsen strikes just the right note of adorable ingenuousness. Howard gets the performance the film needs from her, as her character makes the Grinch's eventual change of heart both believable and touching.
