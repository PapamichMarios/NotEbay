    <Description>A copper chafing dish with black wrought iron 3-legged frame base into which you put a copper pan with water that heats up with a candle (hoder for candle is also inserted into the frame). Then the enameled pan sits into that...has a wooden handle. Has a copper lid that covers the pan. The copper has a nice vintage patina but which with a little elbow grease it can be restored to a beautiful sheen, if desired. Food pan is in mint condition - looks as if it were never used. It stands 9&amp;3/4" tall. The pan is 9&amp;1/2" in diameter x 2&amp;1/2" deep. It measures 16" wide including the handle. A beautiful display piece, just gorgeous for entertaining.

I try hard to work with everybody. Any item(s) not paid for within 15 days of auction end will be re-listed and appropriate feedback posted. If there is a problem preventing you from completing your transaction, let me know and I will work with you. If you don't communicate, I can't work with you. Please-no bids from people with excessive negative feedback or excessive (more then two) bid retractions. Just for the record, I ONLY sell original items, NO _home made_ copies - EVER! For US bidders, all items that qualify for Media Mail Shipping, will be sent at the Media Mail (formerly Book Rate Mail) Rate (7-14 days per the USPS web site), with Delivery Confirmation. For example MOST (but not all) video games, single CD's &amp; single videotapes cost $1.83. ALL Items that do not qualify for Book Rate will be sent Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. For all items shipped at the Media Mail Rate OR Priority -- DELIVERY CONFIRMATION IS MANDATORY -- NO EXCEPTIONS!!!

Items not covered by either Delivery Confirmation (or insurance) WILL NOT BE SHIPPED until the proper fee is paid. If you are the high bidder on multiple items, they will be packaged together whenever possible, to save on shipping. For the convenience of bidders I subscribe to the PayPal service, which allows you to pay with your Visa or MasterCard.

As far as overseas deliveries, unless you elect to take insurance (if available in your country) or some sort of Delivery Confirmation-type service (if available in your country), I cannot assume any responsibility for items sent outside of the US of A. Needless to say, all payments from countries outside the US must be made payable in US dollars. IF you have a non-U.S. checking account, that is payable in U.S. dollars, it MUST be payable through a U.S. bank.

    <Description>Harmony Kingdom BEER NUTS Canadian Exclusive EXCLUSIVE CANADIAN LIMITED EDITION OF 2001 PIECES ONLY AVAILABLE IN CANADA LAST YEAR. The Canadian adventures of Mad Murphy and Moose continue! National symbols of Canada abound on this Box Figurine. Two beavers, Canada s national animal, appear on the piece, one chewing on Moose's skis, the other hitching a free ride on his back. Moose s blanket is emblazoned with a maple leaf and the hat on his head looks suspiciously like standard issue for the RCMP (Royal Canadian Murphy/Moose Police). The area is littered with beer bottles and cans. A few are even stuck in Moose s antlers and a keg is under his belly. Moose has strapped a second keg around his neck, just in case he gets lost or stranded as he evades the RMCP. For ammunition the desperadoes have stockpiled snowballs for those sudden battles with Sgt. Jacques Strappe. The ten snowballs represent Canada s ten provinces. Inside the box is Mad Murphy, who has again foiled the RCMP s attempts to find and capture him. Carvings include Rich Little, a famous Canadian impersonator; DB McKenzie for two well-known brothers; Sir John EH for Sir John A. McDonald, Canada s first Prime Minister, and a play on the Canadian expression eh ; and BA (heart) BA stands for Bryan Amyot loves Brenda Amyot (his wife). Item is mint with box. Winning bidder may pay with credit card online with Pay Pal or Billpoint. Checks, money orders and bidpay also accepted. Please include $6 for shipping and handling. International winners please contact us for revised shipping charges before paying. Discounted shipping on multiple purchases. Good luck !! Buyer to pay $6.00 for shipping and handling.

    <Description>Produced by Planet Studios in the early 1990's, this was a limited edition metal enamel pin. They produced many different pins, mostly of Marvel Comics characters, each of which was produced only one time, in limted numbers, just as a comic book would be, ranging in size from 7/8" to 1 1/2" high. They were distributed only by comic distributors to comic book shops, and so had very limited distribution as well. All of this makes these very hard to find today. Check our current auctions for other great items, including additional pins and Marvel Comics merchandise. WE DO NOT ACCEPT PAYPAL!! Checks drawn on U.S. banks, and payable in U.S. funds, are accepted for payment but require seven business days to clear. Credit cards (MC, Visa, Amex, Discover) and money order/cashiers check payments ship within two business days of receipt. Buyer pays $1.50 shipping and handling fee. We ship U.S. Postal Service within the the United States. International shipments and other forms of delivery may be more. ATTENTION AOL USERS! Their spam blocking software has been blocking some of our emails. If you are an AOL user and do not hear from us within three business days, then it is AOL's fault, not ours!!

    <Description>1994 Miniature Hallmark Keepsake Ornament, Rocking Horse! There is no box with this, just the little miniature ornament, in good condition. I'm selling a LOT of different Hallmark miniature ornaments right now, but I don't know the correct names for very many of them, so please excuse if I get the name wrong....just look at the year and the photos and you should be able to find the ones you want. Please look at my seller's list (may be a few pages long) and bid on all you like. I'll be happy to ship items together to save you as much postage as possible. I'll safely ship from one to six of the minis together in one package for $1 total shipping &amp; handling via First Class mail, or a little more for over six. Or several dozen of them will fit into a one pound Priority Mail box for one charge of $3.50. Either way, you can get a real bargain on postage, but Priority and will get them to you in 2 or 3 days if you're in a hurry. Look around at my auctions and buy as many as you like! The very most you'll pay for shipping, no matter how many you bid on, will be $3.50. :^) Please write if you have any questions, thanks! Checks or money orders are always welcome , as are credit cards through Ebay's Billpoint Online Payments or PayPal. I will contact you after the end of the auction with the information for all methods. International postage will usually be different than amounts stated, so buyers would need to contact me before payment if the item will be shipped outside the USA. Thanks for bidding! *NOTE: If you've won one auction, winning U.S. bidder may pay instantly by clicking on Ebay's check-out feature that will appear at the top of this auction after it ends. You can find the information there that you need for various payment methods, then pay either online or through the mail. If you've won several auctions, I'll also contact you with all your day's wins combined together into one emailed invoice, with low combined shipping, and information on how to pay for multiple purchases either online or through the mail.

    <Description>Presented by Rebecca Gelber, one of eBay's best-loved sellers with over 40000 positive feedbacks - bringing you fabulous treasures at wholesale prices! Here are four beautiful sterling salt spoons in the very popular pattern, Fleur de Lis Shell. This pattern is noted for having some of the most beautiful detailing of both the neoclassically styled handle and very detailed shell inspired bowl.. These spoons measure just over 2 1/2" long each and are marked 925 for 925/1000 pure sterling. They are new and in mint condition. There's no reserve, so have fun bidding! If you like this item, you're sure to love many of the other beautiful jewelry and collectibles I have listed - and if you win more than one auction the shipping charges will be combined, saving you money! Click here to view my other auctions! Want to see related items? Click on the keywords! spoon sterling Note that I now have two eBay names: rgelber and treasured_finds - but not because I want to! I've posted so many auctions up that eBay's search function stopped working on me, and splitting the auctions between the IDs made it work again. I made the auction pages look the same so you'll still know its me, and I will still combine shipping charges just as before, regardless of which IDs auctions you bid on. ( If the picture does not appear click here for an alternate posting ) I accept MasterCard/Visa and checks/money orders in US funds. Checks hold to clear, otherwise I ship within 24 hours. Buyer to pay $2.00 for first-class shipping/handling in the U.S., with insurance optional (but HIGHLY recommended) at $1 for each $50 of value. Seller is not responsible for lost items if insurance waived. Most small items can be shipped airmail overseas for $3.00. California buyers pay sales tax. Please ask any questions before you bid. Payment is expected within 10 days of auction close. Returns accepted within one week of receipt and are for bid price less shipping and fees unless the item received is not as described. Please DON'T use eBay's 'Checkout' on my auctions. In addition to being unreliable, it only works on single items and most of my customers bid on multiple auctions. Until eBay makes Checkout optional the button will be part of all auctions, whether the seller wants it there or not. Thanks so much for looking, and good luck if you bid! rgelber Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>I say the orange color on this old metal bread box is garish. You may disagree. It has curved metal feet and stands 9 3/4" tall and is 18" wide. I do not know if this is original, but someone has attached a magnetic strip inside the door so it will stay shut. I'm not sure how to address condition. It could use a nice cleaning. Some of the paint has chipped off inside. The outside has some wear as well. There is no manufacturer information. If you like this color, my other auctions include a matching turntable/lazy susan with two jars. This is not my area of expertise. If you feel I have failed to address something, please let me know.

    <Description>Produced by Planet Studios in the early 1990's, this was a limited edition metal enamel pin. They produced many different pins, mostly of Marvel Comics characters, each of which was produced only one time, in limted numbers, just as a comic book would be, ranging in size from 7/8" to 1 1/2" high. They were distributed only by comic distributors to comic book shops, and so had very limited distribution as well. All of this makes these very hard to find today. Check our current auctions for other great items, including additional pins and Marvel Comics merchandise. WE DO NOT ACCEPT PAYPAL!! Checks drawn on U.S. banks, and payable in U.S. funds, are accepted for payment but require seven business days to clear. Credit cards (MC, Visa, Amex, Discover) and money order/cashiers check payments ship within two business days of receipt. Buyer pays $1.50 shipping and handling fee.

    <Description>This great old black cat decanter is unmarked, but I am quite sure it is from the Shafford collection. It is made of the red clay, and has the green eyes, red bow and ear linings. She has lost most of her red from her ears, and neck bow, but has most of her green eye paint, and nice features painted on her face. The glaze has some crazing, but no cracks or chips. This decanter measures approx. 7 1/2" tall with her lid on. A very nice addition to your Shafford Black cat collection. Buyer pays postage.

    <Description>This early kitchen item is probably a nut grinder. I doubt if the blades would do coffee, but I could be mistaken. POssibly garlic, or other herb type garden items or spices. The metal handle turns the blades inside the little shoot that holds the nuts to be ground. As they get pieced into little bits, they fall into the Androck jar below. The blue and black and white design feels very early 50's maybe even 40's, and since the number 49 is on the jar, I would place it in this time frame. The blades are somewhat rusty and would need some cleaning it you planned on actually using this. But if you're just adding to your decor in a retro kitchen, it would be fine as it is. Ther is a little bit of ridges on one side, the lowest, and looks like a match striker to me, so maybe this piece did double duty when setting on or near a stove that had to be lit. I cannot think of any other use for the ridges, so if you know, please let me know. Bid early and stake your claim to this unusual piece. See pics and email questions. We accept MC/Visa or Money Orders for immediate shipping and personal checks which require clearance time. Buyer to pay actual priority shipping, no hidden handling fees. By law Iowa residents must pay 6% sales tax or show their tax permit. See our other auctions for a variety of items. Thanks for bidding. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>6.625 yards of a Beautiful polished cotton You are bidding on 6.625 yards of a wonderful fabric suitable for upholstery or drapery. The piece is 54" wide and slightly brighter than it appears in the picture. Please look at our other bhcraver auctions on ebay for even more terrific fabrics! We do not use ebay's "Checkout" option. We accept paypal. Winner to pay shipping. Non smoking environment. We ship via UPS or the Postal Service and are not responsible for uninsured items shipped via the Postal Service that are lost or damaged. We recommend to those of you that have your packages shipped via the Postal Service that you purchase Postal Delivery Confirmation (.40-$1.50) but we will not include this charge unless asked. This is the only method the Postal Service has of tracking your package. If you do not purchase this all we can tell you is the date your package was shipped. Items shipped using UPS are automatically insured. ALL international orders, as well as all shipments to PO Boxes in the U.S., are sent ONLY by the United States Postal Service. Please note that the selvage may have one small hole every yard. The selvage is usually a narrow strip of fabric that runs along both sides of the material and is not used for upholstering. These small holes will in no way effect the use of the fabric. The holes are a result of the way that we sometimes measure short pieces. Please ask any questions you might have about the item BEFORE you bid. If you have any reservations please do not bid as all sales are final. At auctions end we will send the winning bidder an email asking for their address so that we can calculate shipping charges. Due to space limitations we will only consolidate up to ten days worth of winning bids. The ten days begin after the first piece that you win closes. Unfortunately there are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule as we are operating out of a small space and simply do not have the room to consolidate indefinitely. If you do wish to consolidate it is your responsibility to keep track of what you have won. If payment is not received within 2 weeks from end of auction we reserve the right to relist item and leave negative feedback. DO NOT BID IF YOU DON'T PLAN ON PAYING IN A TIMELY MANNER!

You are bidding on a copy of "Doctor Who: Kursaal," written by Peter Anghelides. Printed in 1998 by BBC Books, this Eighth Doctor Adventure has the Doctor and Sam arriving on Kursaal, a planet due for a huge theme park -- if it isn't destroyed during construction... Difficult to come by, this 282-page book is in very good condition; the only flaw is a slight yellow stain along part of the bottom edge of the book, which bleeds a tiny bit into the bottom of some of the pages. This will make a wonderful addition to any Doctor Who fan's collection! Please check out my other auctions; I have quite a few other rare Doctor Who books up for auction right now! TERMS AND CONDITIONS: Buyer prepays for U.S. priority mail shipping plus delivery confirmation, totaling $3.90 (yes, the Post Office went up on its rates again, effective January 7). Insurance, if desired, is optional. I am not responsible for uninsured items which are lost or damaged. Items valued over $75 will be automatically insured. When possible, multiple items will be combined to reduce shipping charges. International bids are welcome, but final payment must be made in American funds (i.e, cash sent at your own risk, or an International Money Order). I also now accept payment via Visa and MasterCard through PayPal. Shipping costs outside the United States will vary depending on bidder's location and will be determined at end of auction. Payment must be received within 10 days of the auction's ending date. Payment by U.S. money order is preferred, but checks are also accepted. Winning bidders will receive a confirmation via e-mail within 24-48 hours of the auction's end; please confirm receipt of the invoice via e-mail within 72 hours.

    <Description>These are adorable wooden chef salt &amp; pepper shakers. They look as tho they were hand painted, but it does not say. The plastic stoppers have the word JAPAN molded into them. I would say these were made in Japan from the style and the stoppers, but there are no labels or stamps to be sure. They also look very old. They measure approx. 1 1/8" diameter x 2 1/2" high. The only flaw I could find was a little paint loss on the top of the salt shaker. The shipping and handling would be $2.50 for first class or $3.95 for priority mail. Insurance is extra if desired.</Description>

Halloooo! they hear it shout and fear a Jagular's about! But Pooh and Piglet do not see it's only Tigger up a tree. This ornament opens and closes like a real book. It is beautiful and perfect for the Pooh or ornament collector. Buyer to pay $4.00 shipping. Thank you. Dated 2001.</Description>

    <Description>You are bidding on 1 issue of "The Phantom" comic book. You get issue #227 in this auction. I don't know alot about comic books, but I will tell you what I can about this one. I think that this one is from the 1960's and was printed in Australia. Just inside the front cover at the bottom of the page it says the following: Distributors-Gordon &amp; Gotch (A'sia) LTD., Sydney Melbourne. On the bottom of the last page it says the following: Printed by Rotary Colorprint Co. Pty. Ltd., 15 Hamilton St., Sydney. Published by Frew Publications Pty. Limited, 149 Castlereagh St., Sydney. The cover is printed in color and the interior pages are all Black &amp; White. The comic contains 32 pages and has a price of 1 pound(?)on the front cover. The cover is a newspaper type paper and does not have the glossy type finish as most comic books do. The comic is in what I would call Excellent condition, maybe better, no major tears. There is no writing on the cover or inside that I have found. The comic measures about 10"x7". Please ask questions before bidding, and I will try to answer them the best that I can. CHECK OUT MY OTHER ON GOING AUCTIONS FOR MORE INTERESTING ITEMS, AND MORE PHANTOM COMICS TO BE ADDED IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. Shipping can be combined on these auctions, if you win more than one. Buyer to pay by money order, paypal, or check in U.S. funds, however checks will delay shipping by at least 10 days. Buyer to also pay $3.95, for Priority Mail shipping, add an additional $1.10, if you want insurance (I will not be resonsible for uninsured items). Buyer to also make payment within 14 days of the end of the auction or items may be re-sold. E-mail me with any questions and I will try to answer them. International shipping will be higher.</Description>

    <Description>Marvel Comics Group - Conan, Kull &amp; Champions _ These comics are in good condition. The covers are in good condition with no major tears, glossy, some creasing and intact. The contents are in very good condition. A great addition to anyone's collection. Here is what the lucky winning bidder gets: Marvel Comics Group Conan the Barbarian No. 26 (Vol 1, No. 26, May 1973 issue staples are pulling through the cover) Marvel Comics Group Kull the Conqueror No. 7 (Vol 1, No. 7, March 1973 issue staples are pulling through the cover and cover is splitting up the seam) Marvel Comics Group The Champions No. 10 (Vol 1, No. 10, January 1977 issue) I scanned the front of one of the comics to give you an idea of their condition.

A superb photography direction, touching performances, a dialogue that hits the nail in the head with every line. A long time since I felt this overwhelmed about a movie, no words to describe it. You feel what the characters are going through. Probably the strongest showcase of loyalty to a true teacher, and the best scene about two people joining their hearts, in a very unique way, without them being together when it happens. The characters transition from young to old is also staggering. The landscapes tell you the story without the need of dialogue or other tools. Simply, a unique experience.

    <Description>Tilda Swinton"Female Perversions"Lesbian DVD PHOTO: DESCRIPTION: Tilda Swinton"Female Perversions" All codes IMPORT Lesbian DVD Directed by SUSAN STREITFELD Starring : TILDA SWINTON, AMY MADIGAN, KAREN SILLAS, FRANCES FISHER_K_K. This is a terrific film about women struggling to discover a way to find and develop their identity. While some of the allusions and metaphors can be a bit heavy handed, they are effective. Eve (Tilda Swinton) is a lawyer about to be nominated for a judgeship. While her professional life is as much as she could wish, her personal life is a mess. She is involved with an architect (male) and a psychotherapist, Renee. But she is unable to connect with either. Her upbringing, devotion to her work, and desperate desire for control have left her emotionally stunted, unable to make a real connection to anyone around her. One day, her sister is picked up for shoplifting. Eve rides to her rescue, and spends several days in the middle of nowhere, with an exotic dancer, a young girl just entering puberty, and a brilliant but shattered friend. Many critics hated this movie (most guides give it just 2 or 3 stars) but I think they couldn't get past Eve's coldness. But this movie is a study in coldness, in emotional death and rebirth. But it is not Eve who is reborn. See it and judge for yourself._K_K Country: USA 1996 NTSC Brand New &amp; Factory Sealed! ALL CODES so that it is playable worldwide!!!

    <Description>This is a playboy centerfolds march 1995 sports time jennifer jackson auto which i packed pulled myself when they first came out and the card is #2700 of 2750 in near mint- Mint condition. These cards are just tough to find now. So ground rules i will only accept United states postal money orders for payments and nothing else, no personal checks, cash, nothing but united states postal money orders. There are two reasons 1st USP MO can be cashed at any post office therefore items can be sent out quicker since i dont have to wait for MO's or personal checks to clear, therefore transactions are quicker. i just opened a paypal account if you can send a payment wihout me incur fees maybe i might accept payment by this form but please email me first. i absoloutelly will not incur fees to get money from buyers, i can wait for the mail to get MO's instead of losing money. otherwise A united states postal money order is the only form of payment i accept. Shipping for one card can either be $2 for the card to be insured for up to $49 and sent in a regular envelope first class mail and only items sent for under $49 can be sent this way otherwise priority mail has to be used so the item can be insured for more or $4.60 for priority insured for up to $49 dollors the more items you buy the more the posibility you have to have the items sent priority mail cost could be more if items have to be insured for more. Insurance forupto $99 and priority is $5.50, priority and insurance for upto $199 is $6.60, priority and insurance for upto $299 is $7.70 and each additional $100 increment is an additional $1.10. its stronglly recommended you buy multiple items so that the cost of shipping and insurance makes sense. if you have any further questions please feel free to email me. If the transaction is not compleated negative feedback will be posted. also please check under sellers other auctions to see if there are other sets or cards you need.

Get to know your seller! We started collecting sports memorabilia about 10 years ago, just for personal collections. We bought items from local sellers, but that was not without a large price tag, as I_m sure we can all relate to :) Our passion for sports memorabilia progressed into wanting to meet our favorite players, so we went through different contacts and getting our autographs that way. Now we travel all over to different events getting autographs in person, hand signed by top athletes and celebrities of today and yesterday. Now I must let you know, that we still DO PURCHASE autographs, and NOT every autograph we sell has been witnessed by us, however we do OUR VERY BEST to ensure that the autographs we sell are only TOP QUALITY and 100% real. That is why we issue a CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY from Spotlight Productions, backed with our full refund guarantee that if you are not completely satisfied with your product, SEND IT BACK ! We don_t want anyone to ever have any displeasure associated with our name! And we mean that! Collecting sports memorabilia should be a wonderful and fun hobby, and we hope that we can assist you in collecting the items you will treasure for years to come!!! Happy Bidding. PLEASE NOTE!!! We accept Paypal, Money orders, Cashiers and Personal Checks. We reserve the right, and WILL NOT ship to UNVERIFIED PAYPAL ADDRESSES .

    <Description>This auction is for a fetal monitor by BeBe Sounds, UNISAR. It contains the monitor unit and a set of headphones to listen to the baby's heartbeat. Requires one 9V battery to operate. There is a volume adjustment and even an additional plug where you can hook up equipment to record the heartbeat onto a cassette. Unit is in EXCELLENT shape. It was hardly ever used, just once or twice because my doctor ended up monitoring my pregnancy very close in the hospital, so this wasn't needed very much. I will accept personal checks, cashiers checks, money orders, and Paypal. Shipping will be actual costs, but I'm sure it shouldn't be more than $3.00 or $4.00. International shipping costs may be more. Happy bidding!</Description>

IT HAS AN ADJUSTMENT FOR THE AMOUNT OF STEAM; NO STEAM, LOW STEAM, OR A TON OF STEAM! ITS REALLY A GREAT MACHINE! IT_S THE STEAM THAT GETS OUT THE WRINKLES AND THIS WILL MAKE THEM GO AWAY! THE HAND HELD STEAMER WORKS GREAT TOO; ITS EASY TO USE AND WORKS GREAT ON SUITS AND SLACKS. THIS ITEM MAKES A GREAT GIFT; JUST ASK MY MOTHER! SHE SPENT OVER $150 ON HER ROWENTA, NOW IT_S ON EBAY!!

    <Description>This vintage enamel on copper plate is not only a striking decorative piece -- it_s also a collectible This vintage enamel on copper plate is not only a striking decorative piece -- it_s also a collectible. The midnight blue enamel gradually fades into a lighter shade, giving the appearance of a highlight along one side of the plate. One can imagine looking into the night sky in the depth of this design. The plate measures 6 _" in diameter and the copper back is embossed: HAND-MADE, MADE IN WEST GERMANY. It is in excellent condition and is ready to grace your home as an accent piece on an easel, as a wall hanging among your collection, or as a lovely accent on your coffee table.

    <Description>Up for auction is some brackets used with the Gravely log splitter used on the 2 wheel tractors. I was told that they mount on the rear hitch. I am not exactly sure but I assume it is to stabalize the tractor since the gear box is a little light &amp; to keep the tractor from rolling if it drifts into gear. I don't use them since my tractor has a stand &amp; parking brakes on it.I accept PAY-PAL (preffered),money order, or cashiers check only.Payment must be made within 10 days of end of auction. Buyer to pay actual shipping charges. E-mail me your zip code at end of auction so I can figure out the charges. I will only ship to the United States.E-mail if you have any questions. Thank You &amp; Happy Bidding.</Description>

    <Description>NINE DIFFERENT STANDING LIBERTY QUARTERS NO RESERVE !! This is a group of nine U.S. Standing Liberty silver (.900) quarters dated from 1925 to 1930. These quarters were struck at various U.S. Mints. [Look for the mintmark on the obverse at 7 o'clock to the left of Liberty's robe.] These quarters are all well circulated but still collectible. Here are the nine Standing Liberty silver quarters you get with my estimate of their grades: 1925(P) VG 1926(P) G-VG 1926-D G 1928(P) G-VG 1928-S G 1928-D AG-G 1929(P) VG 1930(P) VG-F 1930-S VG-F [Note: struck on a clipped planchet, ~1.5%, at 7:30 o'clock] Check out the photographs below. This group is especially well suited to beginning collectors of this hard to find Liberty Standing series as well as inexpensive place-holders for regular collectors. They would also make a great gift for your favorite numismatist. U.S. buyers must pay $3.50 to help with postage; Canadian buyers $4.75; Outside North America $10.00. Checks and money orders drawn in U.S. dollars on any bank outside the U.S. are welcome, but you must include an additional $3.50 to cover correspondent bank fees.</Description>

Capacities range from 20 to 60 GB. An Ultra ATA/100 interface optimizes system performance. Unique design attributes enable shock protection to 400 G. Reduced acoustics enable extremely quiet operation at 3.1 Bels. Idle power consumes only 6.7 watts. Leading drive technology The IBM Deskstar 60GXP disk drive combines new and proven technologies to greatly enhance system performance and capacity--handling a wide range of advanced desktop and audio/video applications. Features such as low acoustics, reduced power, and tagged command queuing are ideal for low-cost routers, entry- level servers, and switches. Advanced desktop systems IBM continues to define state-of-the-art for storage. The high capacities and fast speeds of IBM Deskstar drives support higher quality digital audio/video storage, superior digital content creation capabilities, and significantly faster processing for multimedia and Internet applications. Technology for performance Increased track capacity and servo bandwidth combine with enhanced buffer throughput to significantly improve performance over the previous generation IBM drive. A 2 MB buffer uses advanced buffer management and hardware assisted caching to streamline data transfer. In addition, more servo pulses help ensure faster and more accurate head positioning to reduce head settling time. The IBM Deskstar 60GXP also supports Tagged Command Queuing and Rotational Position Optimization to further enhance throughput for data-intensive Windows NT** and UNIX** applications. Technology for reliability The industry's highest areal density increases capacity while reducing component count to improve reliability. Second-generation load/unload head ramps help protect data from drive mishandling, further enhancing reliability. In addition, glass media provides a smoother disk surface and greater rigidity to reduce the impact of shock. Ceramic spindle bearings and a tri-lamenate top cover reduce acoustics to just 3.1 Bels--a level that matches or improves upon many 5400 RPM models. Circuits and motors are also optimized to save power and reduce system temperature- extending system life and reliability. Deskstar drives utilize proven IBM technologies such as TrueTrack* servo and No- ID* sector formatting, as well as IBM Drive Fitness Test* (DFT), S.M.A.R.T. Self Test, and error logging. _ IBM Deskstar 60GXP at a glance Configuration Interface ATA Capacity (GB) 60GB Sector size (bytes) 512 Recording zones 18 User cylinders (physical) 27,724 Data heads (physical) 6/4/2 Data disks 3/2/1 Max. areal density (Gbits/sq. inch) 15.3 Max. recording density (BPI) 449k Track density (TPI) 34,000 Performance Data buffer 2MB Rotational speed (RPM) 7200 Latency (average ms) 4.17 Media transfer rate (max Mbits/sec) 494 Interface transfer rate (max MB/sec) 100 Sustained data rate (MB/sec) 20.9 to 40.8 Seek time (read typical) _ _Average (ms) 8.5 _ _Track-to-track (ms) 1.2 _ _Full-track (ms) 15.0 Reliability Error rate (nonrecoverable) 1 in 10E13 Start stop cycles (load/unload at 40_ C) 40,000 Power Requirement +5 VDC (+- 5%), +12 VDC (+10%/-8%) Dissipation (typical) _ _Startup current _ _(max A) 2.0(12v) _ _Idle (W) 6.7(3,2,1 disks) Physical size Height (mm) 25.4 Width (mm) 101.6 Depth (mm) 146 Weight (max g) 590 (3 disks), 575 (2 disks), 560 (1 disk) Environmental characteristics _ Operating Nonoperating Ambient temperature 5 to 55_ C -40 to 65_ C Relative humidity (noncondensing) 8% to 90% 5% to 95% Maximum wet bulb (noncondensing) 29.4_ C 35_ C Shock (half sine wave) 55_G/2_ms 400 G (2, 1 disks)_ 350 G (3 disks)_ _ Vibration (random [RMS]) 0.67 G_for_horizontal, 0.56_for_vertical 1.04 G Acoustics (idle) Bels 3.1 (3 disks), 3.0 (2 disks), 2.9 (1 disk) _ The above information exerted from IBM website.

    <Description>This is one of three pieces of Vee Jackson Pottery I have on auction this week. It is a hand decorated footed compote that measures 4 1/4" high and 8 1/2" across. It has a semi-gloss finish that almost looks like a matte finish. Nice fruit design with stylized pineapples, pears, grapes and apples. Colors used are blue, green and yellow. Nice design and shape. It is in good condition with two flaws...the first being a pinpoint glaze chip on the rim. It is very small and only in the glaze and doesn't take away from piece at all. The other flaw is a 1/2" beginning hairline mark at the edge that is visible underneath but not on surface Buyer to pay exact S&amp;H/INS. Use money order/paypal for immediate shipping. Checks are welcome with 7 day clearance.</Description>
