Written by Julie Taymor with Alexis Greene and published by Hyperion in October 1997. This book is new, not used. 192 pages, FIRST EDITION, hardback with dust jacket. Excellent condition with only slight rubbing and surface wear to the dust jacket from shipping and storage. 10 x 11 inches. Winner of six Tony Awards including Best Musical &amp; Best Director. The Broadway adaptation of the remarkably successful film The Lion King is a stunning musical directed by Tony Award-nominated director Julie Taymor. In The Lion King: Pride Rock on Broadway, Taymor takes readers on a revealing journey. From the earliest sketches of costume concepts and set design to the trials and tribulations of mounting one of the most complex Broadway musicals in history, this lavishly illustrated volume allows readers an intimate perspective on the long road to opening night. Known for her singular style as a director and designer of striking costumes, masks, and puppets, Taymor's vision for The Lion King emphasizes the duality of human and animal. Remarkably detailed fabrics, carved masks, and extraordinary makeup bring the characters vibrantly to life. Exquisite sets depict the African savanna, an elephant graveyard, and Pride Rock. Taymor and her co-designer, Michael Curry, showcase the mechanics of the production, its stylized imagery, and distinctive puppetry. As the audience experiences the many scenes - gazelles leaping across the stage, thousands of wildebeest stampeding through the canyon, Timon hanging precariously above a waterfall - they become a part of the magic of theater.

    <Description>This No Reserve auction lot is for issues #1-4 (complete run) of the Oni Press comic series The Coffin by Phil Hester and Mike Huddleston all in NM condition. These comics were bagged, boarded, and never read. Snap them up now--with the publicity of a write-up in Rolling Stone, they have become very hard to find. We prefer PayPal. The buyer pays shipping of $5.50 via USPS Priority Mail. Insurance is available to buyer at cost. This collection of the full run of The Coffin by Hester and Huddleston makes an excellent Christmas gift for the comics fan in your life. If you are interested in Ultimate Spider-man issues, check out our other auction that contains issue #1 (super-rare variant white cover) to combine auctions and save on shipping. Also, watch for our upcoming Ultimate X-men and Ultimate Team-up auctions. Thanks for shopping our auction and have a wonderful holiday season! Reference images are from sample covers.</Description>

    <Description>This is a pair of early amber apothecary bottles. Each bottle has a recessed glass label. The overall condition in good, each one has one chip on the edge of the upper rim of the bottle. I have pictured the chips. Both chips are on the back side of the bottles and are not visible when you look at them from the front. The stoppers are in excellent condition, no chips. They would be a wonderful addition to your medical memorabilia collection. Enjoy bidding!</Description>

    <Description>KT HOUDINI Window Card - Extremely RARE I only know of one other example to exist of this image of Houdini in his most dramatic pose advertising his expose' of Fraudulent Spiritual Communication with Sensational Demonstrations entitled "Can The Dead Speak To The Living?". This measures 11" wide x 16" high having tiny pin holes at the corners and a small corner piece on the bottom right hand side measuring 3/8" x 3/8" on the diagonal absent. This was for a Saturday evening performance with ticket prices being $2.00, $1.50 and $1.00 to be held at the Emory Auditorium under management of Coit-Alber Bureaus in Cleveland Ohio. This has never been cleaned or had restoration work. The aging condition speaks of the character quality of the circa 1924 image that is an absolutely unique piece worthy of being called a museum treasure, no where else will you ever see this again.

    <Description>Star Trek Cinema 2000 Galactic Conflix insert card GC8. Individually numbered 575/750. Nrmt to Mt condition. Hi. Thanks for looking at my auction(s). While I do appreciate everyones business, I would ask that before bidding, you please first read, understand and follow these simple rules to assure a pleasant and successful auction experience. Thank you in advance for your co-operation. Auction rules: 1. Bids accepted from US bidders only and bidders with a feedback rating of 10 or more. If you are outside the US or are new to Ebay and do not have 10 feedbacks yet, I will accept your bid only if you e-mail me prior to bidding for my approval. 2. Winner to provide SASE(Self Addressed Stamped Envelope) with payment. I will provide top loader. I can usually fit three cards in a single SASE, so multiple wins over that will require my bubble envelope shipping for $1.50. 3. Payment is to be received within 10 days of auction end. Non-paying bidder alerts filed 10 days after auction end without receipt of payment and credit requests with appropriate feedback left after 20 days of auction end with no payment received. 4. Payment to be in the form of check, money order or cash only. I can accept Bid Pay, but do not accept PayPal. I always ship next day upon receipt of money orders and cash. I hold all checks 10 days for clearing, no less. 5. If for any reason you think you cannot fulfill these conditions, please do not bid.</Description>

    <Description>Here is an older Snow Village piece: The Village Market! It has an incised mark "Snow Village" "Village Market 1988" and "Department 56" on the bottom. It also has a white paper label that reads "The Original Snowhouse Series 1989" with a Dept. 56 logo. It was issued in 1988 and retired in 1991. It is in basically good, displayed condition with a 1/4" chip on the left, lower roofline, which can be seen in the photo (looks like snow above the left wreath and Village Market sign). The top chip appears to be fixable. There is also a tiny nick on the front base. Includes the light cord; no box. A good buy for the opening price! A nice addition for your SV collection! No hidden reserve. Click "me" for seller info. US buyer pays $10.00 S/H/I. Nebraska resident pays sales tax or provides state sales tax resale number. Thanks!</Description>

There is NO RESERVE! This is one lucky bidder's chance to get their hands on what will surely become a piece of movie making history! US and Canadian winning bidder pays $4.00 shipping, handling and tracking confirmation. United States. Unfortunately, we both have to be sure you receive the item and this is the only way to assure we relieve one another of undue hassle afterwards. Optional insurance will be an additional $2.00 for every $100 bid. Payment must be received within 12 days of the close of the auction in the form of either a money order or check (if you have a positive rating over 10). You may pay via Paypal as well.

    <Description>Wild 1960s Ruffled Lounge Lingerie Sz LG! This is one wild piece! Up for auction is a light nylon one piece lingerie outfit with all the trimmings! This baby has ruffles around the plunging neckline and around the cuffs of the flowing trousers! This piece is in excellent condition- only minor wear and one VERY faint mark on the lower leg that you ll have to search to find! It is a size L and it measures 40 inches in the bust, 38 inches in the waist, 52 inches in the hips and it is 54 inches long. This is meant to fit loosely so it flows like silk when you walk. ENJOY! Please read before bidding ( esp. the stuff in red! ): The pics speak for themselves in this case. It may take a moment to load, but stick around because it's worth it! Please note, all measurements and available tag sizes are included, please be sure to know your size. We cannot be responsible for items that do not fit you, as we do not know your measurements. We have included several images so please be patient. Check our other auctions for even more wild vintage clothing. We carry swing, mod, hippie, rockabilly, lounge, swank, rave, gothic... if you can name it, chances are we've got it! As with all vintage clothes, some wear is to be expected. Unless the description says "MINT," there may be some wear that comes naturally with age. On the other hand, we take all steps to sell only premium items, and should there be any marks, rips or stains, we take every precaution to let you know either in the text or with photos. Bid with confidence- check our feedback! Feel free to email if you have any questions, we re here to help. And don't forget, kids: T-Bone takes Pay Pal! Due to the high cost of international shipping, if you are a non-US bidder we are forced to require a US Money Order (or good old Pay Pal!) and we must re-calculate the shipping prior to payment. US shipping will be $5.00. We can no longer ship any other way than USPS Priority within the US. Priority mail allows for delivery confirmation (which really covers both the seller AND the buyer). Because we must rely on delivery confirmation for verification, we cannot deviate from this policy. This auction is for serious bidders only. Please do not bid on this item if funds are not available for immediate payment. People with overwhelmingly negative feedback are asked not to bid. We will remove these negative bidders from our auctions at our discretion. If payment is not received within ten days from end of auction bidders will be given a negative feedback, be reported to eBay as deadbeat bidder and be removed from any of our auctions. NO RESERVE Buyer to pay $5.00 for shipping and handling. Please click here to see my other auctions. Created by eBay Seller's Assistant Pro</Description>

    <Description>8 OLD LIQUOR MINIS-Various Scotch Brands,'50s Here are 8 old liquor miniatures (minis). These are part of the collection accumulated by my grandfather in the 1950's (maybe some in the late 40's). These are sold as collectibles only, not for human consumption. All but one are all still sealed, although all have evaporated to a large degree; they have wax on the tops, over the tax labels, perhaps applied at a later date to prevent further evaporation. These do show their age... but that's part of their charm! Sold as is. This lot includes: Peter Dawson - Special Blended Scotch Whiskey Grant's Best Procurable Blended Scotch Whiskey Johnnie Walker - Red Label (reverse has 1&amp;1/2_ Florida Liquor Excise Tax stamp/sticker) Johnnie Walker - Black Label Martin's - Original V.V.O.Special Liqueur Blended Scotch Whiskey Ballantine - Liqueur Blended Scotch Whiskey (Fla.

    <Description>Vint. 1970s T-Shirt w/ Pinto Horses- MINT! This is one old shirt and we don t think it has ever been worn- it s in that great of shape! Up for auction is a wild vintage tee with a swell Pinto horse on the front and a cool 1970s style Pinto logo underneath. The graphics are as sharp as the day it was made! Someone did cut the size tag out so here are the measurements you need: 34 (gently stretched to 36) inches in the chest and it is 26 inches long. Could be a baby doll style shirt! GOOD LUCK! Please read before bidding ( esp. the stuff in red! ): The pics speak for themselves in this case. It may take a moment to load, but stick around because it's worth it! Please note, all measurements and available tag sizes are included, please be sure to know your size. We cannot be responsible for items that do not fit you, as we do not know your measurements. We have included several images so please be patient. Check our other auctions for even more wild vintage clothing. We carry swing, mod, hippie, rockabilly, lounge, swank, rave, gothic... if you can name it, chances are we've got it! As with all vintage clothes, some wear is to be expected. Unless the description says "MINT," there may be some wear that comes naturally with age. On the other hand, we take all steps to sell only premium items, and should there be any marks, rips or stains, we take every precaution to let you know either in the text or with photos. Bid with confidence- check our feedback! Feel free to email if you have any questions, we re here to help. And don't forget, kids: T-Bone takes Pay Pal! Due to the high cost of international shipping, if you are a non-US bidder we are forced to require a US Money Order (or good old Pay Pal!) and we must re-calculate the shipping prior to payment. US shipping will be $5.00. We can no longer ship any other way than USPS Priority within the US. Priority mail allows for delivery confirmation (which really covers both the seller AND the buyer). Because we must rely on delivery confirmation for verification, we cannot deviate from this policy. This auction is for serious bidders only. Please do not bid on this item if funds are not available for immediate payment. People with overwhelmingly negative feedback are asked not to bid. We will remove these negative bidders from our auctions at our discretion. If payment is not received within ten days from end of auction bidders will be given a negative feedback, be reported to eBay as deadbeat bidder and be removed from any of our auctions. NO RESERVE Buyer to pay $5.00 for shipping and handling. Please click here to see my other auctions. Created by eBay Seller's Assistant Pro</Description>

    <Description>As you can see in my photo this is a Longaberger 1986 Rare Candy Cane Basket. I am putting this auction on for a friend and believe this little basket to be in excellent shape but missing the brass name plate and from a smoke free household. On the bottom of this handwoven basket is the handwritten initials AN 1986. Buyer will need to pay for shipping. I take money orders and personal checks (which must clear the bank first). Due to slow payers I must ask for payment before 10 days after auction close....Please!!!! Please feel free to look at all of my vintage unique auctions on ebay (I have lots of Longaberger Baskets On !!!) and if you have any questions about this great little collectible basket please feel free to e-mail me at schwan4198@aol.com .

    <Description>Four sterling teaspoons, in the JOHN HANCOCK pattern by Lunt. Each spoon measures about 5 7/8" long, and all four are MONOGRAMMED. Three of the spoons are in good condition, with just light surface scratching. But one of the spoons has damage to the end of the handle, which you can see in the accompanying picture. The spoon is still usable, but you will be able to see the damage. Still a handy "extra" piece, I think.

    <Description>Offered here is a great rare BEAVER quart sealer 7" high. This is a clear sealer with the beaver pointing to the right and in very good condition. There are a few small 'wear' chips less than a 1/16" on the rim, but other than that it is in great clean condition. On the bottom is stamped "12". The lid is probably not original but is a very nice crown lid. I have had this jar for over 20 years and Beaver jars are becoming extremely hard to find so happy bidding.

Set of 9 (?) vintage linen Tea Table napkins I think this is probably a short set....but there are 9 of these vintage linen table napkins. I would really prefer to consider it a set of 8 as one has some light stains. They are about 12 1/2 inches square. No rips or tears. Really don't look like they had much use if any at all. Please take a good look at the photos. If you click on them they will immediately enlarge for a close up view. Happy Bidding. US shipping $3.95 plus insurance. NO RESERVE .These goods are antiques and collectible items selected for qualities acquired over time. I attempt to describe each piece as accurately as possible. Errors and omissions are not intentional. If an item is described as 'mint' it means as it would have come from the store when new. But also please remember that some collectibles were "dime store" items and standards were not the same as upper end merchandise. Money Orders, personal and cashier's checks, and PayPal cheerfully accepted. Paypal, of course, provides you with the quickest shipping. I do not care if you use eBay's checkout option or not. I will contact you after the auction ends or you can contact me with address info. Buyer to pay shipping. On occasion there will be special handling charges for difficult items. INTERNATIONAL shipping figured on a case by case basis. If you want something double boxed or any other special shipping condition, please let me know when responding to winning bidder notice as the shipping costs will have to be adjusted to reflect weight of extra packaging. All glass and pottery will be shipped by USPS only. Insurance will also be included. I can not be responsible for any item that is not insured and will not refund on any uninsured item.

    <Description>Presented by Rebecca Gelber, one of eBay's best-loved sellers with over 40000 positive feedbacks - bringing you fabulous treasures at wholesale prices! I ship the day after I receive payment, so if you win this auction and pay promptly via credit card you should receive it in time for the holidays! I can also ship via Priority or Express Mail for last minute shoppers. Capture every eye with the bejewelled opulance of this fantastic necklace and earring set. It updates the multihued revival fantasies of the Victorian age with hand applied irridescent contemporary glass crystals and beads, set in burnished bronze tone bezels. The central 1 7/8" x 1 3/4" hinged medallion is hung from a complementary chain which is accented by matching beads and crystals. The necklace itself has a built in extender to the chain, so you can wear it from 14 1/2" to 16 1/2" long as you prefer. It is accompanied by a pair of matching 5/8" x 1" post earrings with drops accented with complementary crystals. They are new and in mint condition. There's no reserve on this set, so have fun bidding! If you like this item, you're sure to love many of the other beautiful jewelry and collectibles I have listed - and if you win more than one auction the shipping charges will be combined, saving you money! Click here to view my other auctions! Want to see related items? Click on the keywords! earrings Note that I now have two eBay names: rgelber and treasured_finds - but not because I want to! I've posted so many auctions up that eBay's search function stopped working on me, and splitting the auctions between the IDs made it work again. I made the auction pages look the same so you'll still know its me, and I will still combine shipping charges just as before, regardless of which IDs auctions you bid on. ( If the picture does not appear click here for an alternate posting ) I accept MasterCard/Visa and checks/money orders in US funds. Checks hold to clear, otherwise I ship within 24 hours. Buyer to pay $2.00 for first-class shipping/handling in the U.S., with insurance optional (but HIGHLY recommended) at $1 for each $50 of value. Seller is not responsible for lost items if insurance waived. Most small items can be shipped airmail overseas for $3.00. California buyers pay sales tax. Please ask any questions before you bid. Payment is expected within 10 days of auction close. Returns accepted within one week of receipt and are for bid price less shipping and fees unless the item received is not as described. Please DON'T use eBay's 'Checkout' on my auctions. In addition to being unreliable, it only works on single items and most of my customers bid on multiple auctions. Until eBay makes Checkout optional the button will be part of all auctions, whether the seller wants it there or not. Thanks so much for looking, and good luck if you bid! rgelber Visit rgelber today! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>This Hummel style egg is not marked but definaitly of the Hummel genre. It is a nice item, scene of a little girl preparing to ring a bell with another little child peeking through the door. The stand is gold butterflys, with a gold frame around the edge of the scene and the back is a lovely glossy rose color. The egg is in good condition, no chips, cracks or hairlines. It stands about 3 1/2". Buyer pays s/h/i. I use bubblewrap and styrofoam for packing and double box for fragile items. Therefore I will charge a minimum of .75 for handling, more for large or multiple items. I accept no international sales unless contact is made prior to end of auction.

If I am comfortable with Ebay rating those will be shipped next day also. Full refunds on items plus shipping one way if not as described. Uninsured items are the responsibility of the buyer.

    <Description>Over the next few weeks I'll be offering many great vintage items including great pottery and kitchen collectibles, so come back often and find that perfect vintage Christmas gift for that collector on your list (including yourself!) Thank you! DESCRIPTION: WOW! Pics just won't do this one justice, especially shown on this undersized table! From an estate auction, this elegant and dramatic art deco satin tablecloth with 12 matching napkins will really shine at your New Years celebration! Colors are champagne and pewter. I show both sides in the pics because I can't decide which side is nicer! It measures a whopping 64" wide by 136" long. Comes with 12 matching napkins that measure 21" x 21". This tablecloth is sold "as found". There are no tears, snags or damage, but this set must be cleaned. I found one small smudge on the tablecloth, three of the napkins are soiled but should clean up nicely with a proper soak. Don't miss this one! Please, U.S. shipping only!Winning bidder pays $6.95 shipping. Payment made be made via Paypal, Billpoint or money orders. Regretfully, personal checks cannot be accepted. Personal checks will be returned to the winning bidder and the transaction will be deemed null and void. I apologize to all honest and sincere bidders in advance for the "hard line" on this issue. The winning bidder will pay USPS priority shipping. I email the winning bidder within 48 hours after the auction closes, listing the item number, the title, and the total amount due including shipping. Please acknowledge this message by emailing me at CtYankeeEconsign@cs.com and including your name and address with your reply. I would appreciate it if you would also include the item number and title with your payment and correspondences so I'll know just what belongs to you. Thanks very much! Unless noted otherwise, all items I offer are used, vintage, etc. All sales are final. Condition of items vary and I do my best to point out flaws when I see them, but "perfect" or "flawless" are in the eyes of the beholder. NOTE: In most cases, textiles such as tablecloths, fabrics, doilies, etc are NOT cleaned by me. Most vintage textiles may have light soil, dust, etc. and should be cleaned by the buyer, as most buyers of textiles have their own favorite techniques and preferences. I make no claims of expertise in any of the items that I sell. While it is my responsibility to describe the item I have up for bids as accurately as possible, it is YOUR responsibility to READ that description. Please do not make assumptions regarding an item. If you have questions, email me and ask BEFORE you bid. Remember! Ebay is a great place to find those special items that we may not find elsewhere, but more than that, we are a group who want to share friendly, enjoyable transactions! So relax, enjoy, and good luck!</Description>

    <Description>PEE DOG by "The Shit Generation" Spooky Comics, circa 1982 16-page mini comic book, by "Eddie Nukes" (Jay Condom) and "Jocko Levant Braniac 5" (Gary Panter) Quite possibly the most disgusting, infantile, scratchy, ratty and hilarious comic book ever published. Appropriately, it's low tech all the way: off-register photocopying, every page a slightly different size, and the art bleeds off the pages. Published sometime around 1982. I ordered this copy from Raw Magazine's mail order service. A gross stocking stuffer for the arrested adolescent on your shopping list! Successful buyer pays $4.00 for priority mail shipping. Payment by Money Order, Cashier's Check, PayPal or eBay Payments. US bidders only, please. Age Statement required - Buyer must be over 18 years of age!</Description>

    <Description>RARE &amp; HTF 1991 Felix the Cat Cookie Jar LOOK This is a beautiful RARE &amp; HTF 1991 Felix the Cat Cookie Jar. It is in overall great condition. There are no chips or cracks. There is some minor wear to the paint around the top rim of the jar itself from where the lid rests as well as on the lid on the bottom part that rests on the jar part. There are also a few small spots on the back part of the body (small in nature and really not even worth mentioning) where the paint is missing as well as on the tip of one ear. All of this really sounds much worse than it looks and considering it is cold paint, I would say that's pretty good. It measures almost 11 inches high and about 6 1/2 inches wide at the widest point. It is marked on the bottom with a black ink stamped Benjamin &amp; Medwin, Inc. N.Y.N.Y. 1991 Felix The Cat Productions, Inc. Made in Taiwan. Buyer to pay shipping, handling &amp; insurance. If paying by personal check, please allow up to 14 days for clearance. Money Order ships day received or next day. PayPal accepted and item shipped within 24 to 48 hours of money received in account. I also accept payment plans and will work with you on this, just inquire in email. MY EMAIL ADDRESS IS AS FOLLOWS: Goinggoinggone2u@aol.com. You can contact me anytime for anything!!!! Please note that I will contact you within three (3) days of auction ending. All items are shipped 2 day priority mail with insurance unless otherwise stated by buyer.

    <Description>Atom #18 VF Description I'm putting up a recently purchased collection of mostly Silver Age DC and Marvel Comics, mostly in fine or better condition. In order to get as many to auction as possible, I will be less wordy than usual - the nice large cover scans speak for themselves. Covers have excellent gloss and bright colors! Inside pages are off-white, pages intact, covers and centerpieces intact unless otherwise stated. Any special comments will be below. No Reserve on these babies - they are priced to sell, with starting bids at around 20-30 percent of guide! Combine items from multiple auctions and save on shipping! E-mail me with any specific questions! Payment and Shipping Shipping Terms: Buyer to pay $3.25 shipping charges for this item for shipments within the 48 continental United States only. Insurance is extra at the following rates: Value of Items Insurance Cost 0.00-50.00 $1.10 50.00-100.00 $2.00 each additional $100 add another $1.00! Packages generally do not get lost, and we don't recommend Insurance for items under $100 unless you feel like spending the extra $2.00, however please note that uninsured items are shipped at the buyer's risk! You may also request delivery confirmation for an additional $ 0.40. Texas Residents add 8.25 percent Sales Tax. Preferred method is US Mail but United Parcel Service may be used if requested, or if less expensive than US Mail. Inquire as to extra cost. International Shipments and non-continental US Shipments are made by US Mail using exact postal rates plus $3.00 handling charge. Insurance is only available for some non-US shipments - please inquire. All items come with a 7 day, No Questions Asked refund policy unless otherwise stated in the Auction details! .

We will get all your information from those payment services. We just want you to acknowledge that you realize you won the auction! If you have bid on and won multiple items we can combine items to save you shipping costs - please let us know where we are sending these items and we can calculate a discounted rate rather than combining all the individual shipping costs. Also plese let us know if you are outside the United States so we may correctly calculate shipping costs.

If so, that's good for you and bad for us! Why such a big scan on our comic book covers?

    <Description>This is a copy of DR. STRANGE #169, a silver age comic from 1968. It is the first issue of Dr. Strange pre-dating the number 1 issue. I have had this comic graded by a respected comic dealer that has been in the business for over 40 years and he grades it as FINE PLUS A very nice book with nice color, nice tight spine and no folds or creases. It does have some light tanning on inside and on back cover that keeps it from a higher grade. There is a 3.95 charge for priority shipping, Insurance is extra.</Description>

    <Description>About 5&amp;1/2" across and 1&amp;3/4" deep this is an unusual piece. I am told it is circa 1900. On the bottom is imprinted Ivory Lyralin Labelle. The swastica pre-dates the Nazi symbol and if I am not mistaken the legs are bent in the opposite direction. Inside each leg of hte swastica is a different letter, B V D X. It has black (or Navy blue?) trim around the outside with 8 little greenleaf patterns spaced equally. It is in good shape--some staining on the inside and a little stain at about 11 o'clock. (For more info about the swastica, see below). Please e-mail with any questions. Buyer to pre-pay with s&amp;h. Please view our other auctions for more great stuff!___________________________________: This is translated from a foreign site, so please excuse the syntax and spelling::: Mayoria of the people when listening swastica immediately relates it to Hitler, nazism, but in fact this he is not simbolo of Nazi invention, the swastica has old origins. Their roots, according to some books of history, overcome it to the Era of Bronze. The word Swastica or Cruz Gamada, as some call to him, is derived from "the svastica" sanscrito that ignifica s "well-being". It was used in the antiguedad like simbolo of prosperity and good fortune, simbolo of peace and alegria. It has been used in the primitive currencies of the old Mesopotamia, by the Egyptians like representation of the power that each human being has in himself, has been used in the buddhism, also used like decoration, amulet and talisman. This simbolo habia used in all the continents, except in Australia, before Hitler chose it like simbolo Nazi. Two types of swasticas exist, the one that turns in opposite direction of the small hands of the clock, that is sauvastika; and the one that turns in direction of the small hands of the clock (the Hakenkreuz), this was the used one by the Nazis, usually is considered like simbolo to pave. The swastica usually represents the night and is used often in magical practices. This symbol, was the maximum sign of the Divinity, as it is it today the Cross for the Christians. The Nazi party decidio to use this simbolo like flag of its party in the year of 1919, and was when volume great height and by more than fifty years the Nazism of Hitler has followed alive in the sw_stica. The Nazi connotation that nowadays has the sw_stica is so strong that it cannot be forgotten. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

What you are bidding on is, a very nice sign, that no bar, or game room should be without. It has a very nice etched wood frame, and the sign is not paper. The sign is printed on the back of the glass, like a liqoure mirror. It is an advertisement for Old Sunny Brook Kentuckey Whiskey, and it looks great hanging on any wall. I dont know how old this is, but I have had it for a very long time. It is in very good condition, and it measures 13 1/4" wide, and 8 3/4" tall. I would guess that this is from the 50s or 60s, but I am not sure. This would make an exellent addition to any game room, or bar, and it would make a great christmas gift. Buyer pays $5.20 shipping. I have other liqoure oriented items. Just click "view sellers other auctions" and see There will be an extra $1.10 charge to be insured and I am not responsible for uninsured items. Check the other neat things that I have on auction and if you have any questions, please email me at jefbruce@hotmail.com Happy bidding! Payment I accept the following forms of payment: PayPal, Money Order, no personal checks please!.

    <Description>6.125 yards of a marvelous fabric No Reserve You are bidding on 6.125 yards of a wonderful fabric suitable for upholstery or drapery. The piece is 54" wide and is a linen/cotton blend. You are actually bidding on two pieces of the same material. One is 3.625 yards and the other is 2.5 yards. Please look at our other bhcraver auctions on ebay for even more terrific fabrics! We accept paypal. Winner to pay shipping. Non smoking environment. We ship via UPS or the Postal Service and are not responsible for uninsured items shipped via the Postal Service that are lost or damaged. We recommend to those of you that have your packages shipped via the Postal Service that you purchase Postal Delivery Confirmation (.40-$1.50) but we will not include this charge unless asked. This is the only method the Postal Service has of tracking your package. If you do not purchase this all we can tell you is the date your package was shipped. Items shipped using UPS are automatically insured. ALL international orders, as well as all shipments to PO Boxes in the U.S., are sent ONLY by the United States Postal Service. If you plan on purchasing more than one item and wish to consolidate shipping do not use the "checkout" option which appears after an auction closes. Please note that the selvage may have one small hole every yard. The selvage is usually a narrow strip of fabric that runs along both sides of the material and is not used for upholstering. These small holes will in no way effect the use of the fabric. The holes are a result of the way that we sometimes measure short pieces. Please ask any questions you might have about the item BEFORE you bid. If you have any reservations please do not bid as all sales are final. At auctions end we will send the winning bidder an email asking for their address so that we can calculate shipping charges. Due to space limitations we will only consolidate up to ten days worth of winning bids. The ten days begin after the first piece that you win closes. Unfortunately there are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule as we are operating out of a small space and simply do not have the room to consolidate indefinitely. If you do wish to consolidate it is your responsibility to keep track of what you have won. If payment is not received within 2 weeks from end of auction we reserve the right to relist item and leave negative feedback. DO NOT BID IF YOU DON'T PLAN ON PAYING IN A TIMELY MANNER!

    <Description>This lovely compote appears to be somewhat old and it certainly is unique. The compote is made of solid copper, stands 4" tall on a stemmed base by 7" across at the top with a bowl that is 1 and 1/2" deep, and has on the bottom a gold and brown paper label that reads "COPPERCRAFT GUILD -- TAUNTON, MASS." Overall, this compote is in very good condition. However there are two tiny dents (one in the rim and one in the bowl) and some minor use scratches. United States buyer to pay $5.00 postage and handling -- Canadian rate given after sale. Buyer paid insurance is optional. US or international money order or PayPal ships in a few days. US check must clear bank. Please e-mail any questions. THANKS FOR VIEWING MY AUCTION AND HAVE A NICE DAY!</Description>

    <Description>6.5 yards of Beautiful Flowers No Reserve You are bidding on 6.5 yards of a wonderful fabric suitable for upholstery or drapery. The piece is 54" wide and is a linen/cotton blend. Please look at our other bhcraver auctions on ebay for even more terrific fabrics! We accept paypal. Winner to pay shipping. Non smoking environment. We ship via UPS or the Postal Service and are not responsible for uninsured items shipped via the Postal Service that are lost or damaged. We recommend to those of you that have your packages shipped via the Postal Service that you purchase Postal Delivery Confirmation (.40-$1.50) but we will not include this charge unless asked. This is the only method the Postal Service has of tracking your package. If you do not purchase this all we can tell you is the date your package was shipped. Items shipped using UPS are automatically insured. ALL international orders, as well as all shipments to PO Boxes in the U.S., are sent ONLY by the United States Postal Service. If you plan on purchasing more than one item and wish to consolidate shipping do not use the "checkout" option which appears after an auction closes. Please note that the selvage may have one small hole every yard. The selvage is usually a narrow strip of fabric that runs along both sides of the material and is not used for upholstering. These small holes will in no way effect the use of the fabric. The holes are a result of the way that we sometimes measure short pieces. Please ask any questions you might have about the item BEFORE you bid. If you have any reservations please do not bid as all sales are final. At auctions end we will send the winning bidder an email asking for their address so that we can calculate shipping charges. Due to space limitations we will only consolidate up to ten days worth of winning bids. The ten days begin after the first piece that you win closes. Unfortunately there are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule as we are operating out of a small space and simply do not have the room to consolidate indefinitely. If you do wish to consolidate it is your responsibility to keep track of what you have won. If payment is not received within 2 weeks from end of auction we reserve the right to relist item and leave negative feedback. DO NOT BID IF YOU DON'T PLAN ON PAYING IN A TIMELY MANNER!

    <Description>Hallmark rarely made the colored panoramic ball ornaments. This 1994 ornament is in excellent condition for its age. I believe this is the original box, it is also dated 1994 and is in excellent condition. The box reads, "A Christmas Vigil". One side is a little girl hiding a present she obviously is going to give the the little boy peeking in the window. The little boy is hiding a present behind his back, to give to her. Sooo sweet, is this piece. Buyer pays $4.00 S/H. Payable by certified bank check, money order. Payment due within 10 days of close of auction. Visit my other Hallmark ornament auctions.

    <Description>GREEN ARROW CGC NM+ 9.6 KEVIN SMITH STORY In his first work for DC comics, Kevin Smith brings Oliver Queen back from the dead as only Kevin Smith can. One of the hottest title of the year 2001, Kevin Smith revitalized this character and breathed new life into him with humour and mystery. This copy has been graded by the CGC, the highest authority in grading due to the diligence, care and experience of their graders. It has recieved a grade of NM+ 9.6. It was also among the last few that got slotted with the red Modern Grade. All comics sent in now get the blue Universal Grade mark. It doesn't make any difference in the book, just an oddity. :) If you are or have a Green Arrow fan in your family, this makes a wonderful Christmas gift. Use the buy now option, pay with PayPal and the odds are good that the book will be under the tree. (Naughty boys and girls need not bid.) Winning bidder pays all shipping and handling fees. Buyer must reply within three (3) days of the end of auction. Payment must be made within two (2) weeks (that is payment must be received by me within that time) of auctions end. If you cannot do this, do not bid as failure to follow these policies will result in the cancellation of your bid and negative feedback. Please check out my other auctions as multiple winning bids can be combined to lower the cost of shipping. I ship worldwide and accept international money orders in US funds and PayPal.

    <Description>4 1/4" mixing bowl with spout, sailboat, anchor and wheel. It has a different color of white at the bottom versus the top 2/3's. I do not know who made this bowl. It is in great shape with the exception of the inner top band. There are some chips of glass out as well as rough area for at least half the inner top. On the inside and on the outside I think someone might have used a scouring pad and left some color in the white. The top is about 6 1/2" in diameter. Buyer will pay shg/ins. I do NOT charge handling fees. Will accept personal check or money order. Will NOT accept Paypal. See the other items listed on my auction site. Good luck! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>This is an auction lot of 30 vintage quilt squares featuring the churn dasher pattern. They measure approximately 10 inches square, and this would make a quilt measuring approximately 60" x 72" after borders are added. They are all in excellent condition, but there are a few stained pieces (see photos). I pictured all the stains that I saw, but there may be others. I have not laundered the squares, so I don't know if these will wash out. This would be a great addition to your collection! NO RESERVE! High bidder please note: If you live in or near New York, we have been having trouble getting emails to go through. Please bear with us. We will keep emailing or call you at the number you have listed with Ebay. We don't have a problem receiving your emails, so if you wish to email another phone number to us, we will call you at that number. Also, we are in the process of rearranging our lives (new career), so if we suddenly drop off the face of the earth, don't worry, we will contact you and respond to your emails between the fires we are putting out. Shipping and insurance are additional and will be paid by the winning bidder. International shipping (including to Canada) is usually more than that quoted after the auction, so please let us know if the item is to be shipped internationally. Foreign customers please note: we will not lie on the customs form. If you must pay customs then please figure that in your bidding. Payment must be received within 10 days or negative feedback will be given. We accept money orders and checks. Shipping will be delayed for 2 weeks if payment is made with a check. We no longer accept Paypal as payment . Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.
