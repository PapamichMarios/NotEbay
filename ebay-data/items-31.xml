    <Description>Boutique Quilted Vest Size S * Brand New * By Karen Stephens This is the back of the vest: A unique and beautiful creation, truly a work of art. This vest is brand new, never worn, and would make a very appreciated gift. Sorry for my poor photography--the vest is much prettier in real life. It's by Karen Stephens' "Just A Few" label. This is all hand made, and very well done. The material is very high quality specialty quilting material--some of it in subtle metallic gold. The theme is astronomy--sun, moon, stars, and clouds. It's fully lined. The front closes with an oriental style frog fastener. The vest is a slightly longer style you can wear over a blouse or simple dress. It's a size small--the bust measures 39", and from the top of the shoulder to the bottom hem is 27". Outstanding craftsmanship. You are getting a tremendous bargain here! Please see the other Karen Stephens vest I have listed. Check out my other unique bargains! Click here. $ Great bargain $--$ Low Shipping $ Priority $3.50--too heavy for 1st Class Check Out available for Priority, insurance optional. If making multiple purchases: Wait for me to send you a combined invoice to be paid all at once. The reason for this is that there is a hefty charge for each electronic payment. Buyers who disregard this request will have to pay the additional BillPoint or PayPal fees out of their own pocket. If you have any questions, I would be happy to provide the answers. Please resolve any questions ahead of bidding, as this is final sale. Email me at mzalez@home.com . My home is smoke-free and pet-free. I have many other great Mayan items listed, too! Good quality--no junk. Low shipping! Please check my auctions frequently Payment I accept money orders, personal checks, PayDirect, BillPoint, BidPay, and PayPal. I'll automatically ship your purchase immediately on all payment forms except personal checks, which need to clear. However, if you have good feedback I'll ship right away on a personal check, too. Feedback If you have a lot of negative feedback, I reserve the right to cancel your bid. Also, if you bid and don't pay I do leave negative feedback and file for final value fee credit. Please don't bid unless you intend to pay. Shipping USPS shipping in the U.S. (does not include the price of the item): Your choice of shipping method. The optional insurance is $1.10 extra for each $50 of coverage, and is highly recommended. Although I am a careful packer, please note if you choose not to insure I can't be held responsible for loss or damage by the post office. You always get the best shipping prices when you buy from me. I can ship other methods, too, if you prefer, such as UPS, FedEx--let me know. You will pay all shipping costs, but note that I don't believe in tacking on the so-called 'handling charges'. You pay only the actual shipping costs . The reason for this is I buy a lot on ebay and it burns me up to see someone charging an outrageous 'handling fee'. Thanks for listening to me rant... Never a 'Handling Fee' I will combine shipping for you to save you $$$ International customers are welcome! I love international customers, but please don't bid and then decide not to honor your bid because you don't like the shipping price. Please ask for the shipping price first, I would be happy to find out for you. Also please pay in US dollars, such as in an international money order. For your convenience I also take BidPay: Please see my other auctions! (click here) You won't be sorry! Copyright 2001 M. Gonzalez</Description>

    <Description>MacGear STASH POCKET Wide Leg Pants Raver 36 Description MacGear STASH POCKET Wide Leg Pants Raver 36 Have a little something you need to stash at your next rave? Need to stash it SO WELL that if someone were to pat you down and completely frisk you they wouldn_t find what you_re hiding? Well these pants may be just what you_ve been looking for! Size 36 with a waist measuring 36_, and an inseam of 32_. Cuff (around the ankle) measures a nice big 26_ (adjustable with stretchy pull string and plastic bobble clip), these pants have the most perfectly hidden stash pocket. I_ve worked with a LOT of rave pants in my time (just look at my other auctions!) and I_ve rarely ever seen a cleverly hidden stash like these have. Instead of being located in the traditional spot, on the seam between the legs, this pair has the stash pocket hidden INSIDE the pants, just a little pouch hanging from the inside of the waist. You have to see it to believe it! The fabric is 100% cotton, very fine weave for mega-softness and breathable comfort. Orange contrast seams throughout. TWELVE POCKET STYLE includes the traditional front and butt pockets, as well as tons of Velcro and zipper pockets throughout (and the stash pocket, of course!) so you can carry all your essential hands-free! And dance your butt off without losing anything! Description confusing you? Just wait for the pictures to load! Best of all though, the bidding is starting WAY below the going price for this style and brand of pants!!! Quality Name Brand, no seconds or poorly made _wanna-be_ _posers_ here. I list for auction many top quality Rave items mostly NEW WITH TAGS like this pair! A range of different sizes too! Brand names! So be sure to check out all my auctions and have fun! Don_t miss out! IF THESE DON_T FIT YOU: Check out my other auctions to find them in YOUR size! Remember, if you order more than one thing from me, I_ll combine the postage AND throw in a special little surprise for your next rave! (It could be a glow stick, new candy for your wrist, a glow bracelet, a colorful whistle, a binkie, or one of a million other things! The more you purchase, the more you get!) NOW YOU CAN JOIN TONS OF OTHER RAVERS IN _CELTIC ECHOES_ CANDYLAND_: Just send me a picture of yourself wearing the funky item you bought from me and I_ll post it on the upcoming _CelticEchoes_ RaveCandyland.com and RaveKiss.Com website!

    <Description>Hi you are bidding on one of the coolest sweaters I have ever seen! The sleeves were made separately and added on by a set of strings on the top and on the bottom! The end of the sleeve is just a point, so I think you wear it over the thumb. The turtle neck was also separated and added back on by a few strings on each side! This Orange sweater is made by Sergio Valente and the tags are still on....RETAIL IS $$$$98.00!!!!!! This is a size small, 45% Mohair 30% Nylon 25% Acrylic. It is very very soft! Dry clean only. As stated earlier it still has the tags on it, it is brand new and from a smoke free home! This is the only sweater I have like this, it is so funky! Please ask all questions before bidding because all sales are final. Buyer to pay actual shipping, no handling fee, as well as insurance. I welcome check (10-14 BUSINESS day hold) and money orders (mailed within 48 hours after receipt of m.o. ) Sorry I no longer accept Paypal.

    <Description>New Page 1 PINK &amp; GRAY PIN-STRIPED VINTAGE DUSTER-- Sm. This is a beautiful coat!_ I love it especially since it's got that 1930's/40's appeal. The outside of the duster is tailored beautifully._ The collar is long and pointed _on either side and special attention has been paid to the detail of the slash pockets-- they have a pointed arrow design._ Four lovely, shiny, pinkish-gray _buttons adorn the front._ I like to fasten the top button for that cute, _"little dolly" look!_ It appears that the light pink liner has required some repair, and so the previous owner did some stitching around the collar._ The hemline of the liner also seems to be finished by hand._ There is a tiny tear on the inside, right sleeve of the liner, which is of course unnoticeable._ This coat is in superb condition!_ I see no flaws on the outside._ I would suggest that the wearer of this _coat be either a size small or a small medium._ I am a "solid small" and the coat _fits me perfectly._ Oh... I am 5'6" and it falls just below the knee. Lovely piece for the vintage coat collector!!__ Happy bidding. =) _ buyer pays $8 shipping via USPS U.S. bidders only! buyer must pay within 7 days of end of auction PAYMENT VIA PAYPAL OR MONEY ORDER ONLY Pay me securely with your Visa or MasterCard through PayPal! function dw(nu){document.write(s1+"ppsl"+nu+".gif"+s2+sA[nu]);}f1="document.links";s1="\ ","\"Winning bidder, click here to pay instantly by credit card!\"\","\"Winning bidder, click here to pay instantly by credit card!\"\");c1=c2=c3=c4=0;for(i=0;i =0){c1++;}else if((eval(f1+"["+i+"].search")).indexOf("BetterSeller")=0){c2++;}else if((eval(f1+"["+i+"].search")).indexOf("ListItemForSaleShow")=0){c3++;}else if((eval(f1+"["+i+"].hash")).indexOf("ListItemForSaleAutosShow")=0){c4++;}}if((c1=2)||(c20)||(c30)||(c40)){dw(3);}else{dw(2);}f11="xclick-auction";f13="iid=";f14="";for(i=0;i 0){s11=document.links[i].search;j=s11.indexOf(f13);if(j0){s11=s11.slice((j+(f13.length)));for(k=0;k =0){var p=new Array();p[0]=document.links[i].protocol;p[1]=document.links[i].hostname;p[2]=document.links[i].pathname;for(j=0;j _____</Description>

    <Description>SOAPWERKS This Auction is for one bar of "Peppermint Winterland" handcrafted soap weighing approx. 5 oz!! No puny bars of soap here. To ensure freshness, I make my soap in small batches here in my kitchen, in a small suburb of Chicago Illinois. My handcrafted soaps are made to retain ALL of their natural Glycerin. Glycerin occurs naturally in the soapmaking process and is very gentle and moisturizing to the skin. Commercial soap manufactures remove the natural Glycerin from their soap and sell it as a by-product, wich result in more profits for them but a drying bar of detergent for you. Most of the soap found today is full of detergents! Unlike commercial soap, my homemade soap is DETERGENT FREE!! While detergents are fine for washing the floor or cleaning the bathroom, they're hardly suitable for bathing or washing in. :) My handmade soap is made from a base of saponified vegtable oils, it does not contain animal products of any kind and is 100% cruelty free. It cleases gently while removing impuities and is not drying to your skin. It contains only the highest quality essential oils making it extremely moisturizing and luxurious. I add coconut Oil, Olive Oil, Palm Kernal Oil, Avacado Oil, Sweet Almond Oil, Apricot Kernal Oil, and Vitamin E to every bar. It lathers up beautifully and rinses away cleanly. Simply put: My soaps are Fabulous! This soap features fun swirls and curls, squares and triangles inside a striking ice blue soap. It is scented with "Peppermint Winterland" fragrance oil. Unlike alot of the mind clearing, eye opening, nostril clearing peppermints out there, this one has a touch of sweetness to it, kind of like those ever popular little red and white candies. Peppermint is known to reduce fatigue and stress while increasing mental alertness. Personally, I like to take a bath with this soap before bed as I find the scent very relaxing. BOTTOM LINE: This peppermint is not too strong and not too sweet..its just right! All my soaps arrive in a cello bag tied with a decorative ribbon. Shipping : $3.95 for 1-10 bars. Please feel free to combine auctions to save on shipping. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information. Payment Instructions Satisfaction guaranteed. If you are not happy with my soap, please return it to me for a full refund. Thanks and Happy Holidays!</Description>

    <Description>HEADBAND/SNOOD NETTING "BLACK ICE" HINTS OF SILVER SPARKLE IN THE HEADBAND MAKE IT PLAY WITH THE LIGHT. My snood/hair jewelery with head band. It all started when my sister wanted a more fashionable way to put back her hair. Looking around at snoods and headbands gave me an idea! Very similar to a pattern from the forties,but of my own design. Now I have been getting requests and seemingly starting a trend! These snood/headbands are much better than your average scrunchie or headband. It is a combination of a snood(hair netting) and headband. The trouble with snoods is that you need to wear hair pins or combs to keep them in place. With my design,you can wear this exquisite piece with out the pins! It does not matter what length your hair is either! If you have short hair,it appears to be much longer due to the hanging netting.If you have long hair, it is kept neatly in place! GREAT way to hide a "bad hair day" or just to make a fashion statment!If you are in the food industry and need to put your hair back, no problem! This not only does a great job but it looks Fab! Great for that rennisance look as well! The added laced through accents can be easily removed. I intended it to be that way so that you could thread your own ribbon or andornments of your liking.Of course you could just keep them in as well making this unique head dress very versatile! My snood nettings are finished unlike most snoods out there so that the elastic cording is well hidden.If you need to adjust the cording carefully find the gold elastic tied end and retie it for a perfect custom fit! Each one of my snoods are carefully hand made. This design is black with shimmery silver accents woven into the headband. I call this one "Black Ice". Truly one of my favorites. You can wear black with anything! Ive choosen for the accents to the headband 2 rows of silver beading that bring out the woven silver of the headband. The pictures didnt catch how the light plays with this one! Ive included a picture of me in the multi-colored snood that is also up for auction so you can see what it looks like on a real head :)You are bidding on the black one in this auction. The design is the same. Look at my other auctions for more color choices! This headband measures 14 inches across and the netting hangs down about 9 inches. Shipping is $3.50 priority.If you prefer,I will ship first class. Insurance is available at an additional $1.10.I am not responsible for loss or damage if insurance is not purchased.International bidders email for a shipping quote.No handling fees just the cost of shipping. I will glady combine on shipping charges,Depending on the final weight. (2 headbands are still $3.50)International bidders please email me for a shipping quote.No hidden costs, just shipping. I accept Paypal,Billpoint or money orders. Sorry, NO personal checks! E-checks need to clear before shipping.(about 4 business days) I also request that my winning bidder contact me within 3 days of end of auction,and payment within 10 days of end of auction.THANKS FOR LOOKING AND HAPPY BIDDING! :)</Description>

    <Description>Authentic Dooney and Bourke Stephanie Tote/Purse/Handbag/Purse. Bone in color. Brass fob and cloth tag w/ serial number are present. This bag is used and does show signs of wear such as ink spots inside scuffing on bottom and darkening on straps. However, this purse is still very pretty and has plenty of life. Dooneys are built to last years!! I am only selling it because it is not big enough for me so there is no point in me keeping it. I believe it is about 10__ wide at its widest point and about 8__ high but I don't have the purse in front of me so these measurements are approximate. Please feel free to ask any questions during the auction. I accept PayPal only at this time...Please please please-serious bidders only-I have gotten stuck with some real deadbeats lately! Shipping for the winning bidder is $6 and insurance is additional and optional. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>Nice little lot of basic turtlenecks size 6, one is marked a 5, but it is the same size as the two 6's. There is pale yellow, blue, and lavendar, all in good shape, things to mention the blue has some very faint have to look for stains and a small spot on the cuff is apart, not a hole though hard to explain. Priority shipping is $3.50. I will combine auctions won within a few days of each other. I will also ship via a different class upon request. Just go to www.usps.com and calculate shipping to get the best value. You will need my zip of 70817 and the weight of 9.9 ozs. for this package. The cheapest rate is going to be around $2.41 depending on your zip code. I try to calculate shipping as close as possible before going to the postoffice and I don't add in a handling charge therefore giving you the best value which is why we shop ebay. I accept Paypal, Ebay payments, money order, or check (checks will be held till cleared) I ship within 24 hours of payment being received except with checks. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

Contact: If you have a problem with this product that requires warranty service, please phone Aerotek at 1-773-229-0048. ATTENTION TEXAS RESIDENTS The state of Texas requires that I collect state and city taxes based on the buyer's shipping address in Texas. I feel that the additional 7.25-8.50 percent charge I would have to impose is unfair to Texans. When I purchase items over the net, I avoid Texas sellers to prevent being taxed. For me, selling to Texas residents is not worth the additional hastle of computing city/state taxes, maintaining records, and dealing with the state. For these reasons, I intend to only sell outside the state of Texas. One of the biggest advantages of purchasing through the Internet is not having to pay tax, it rubs me the wrong way to do so. I can not legally sell to Texans without taxing them so the only other option I have is to not sell to residents of Texas. I sure hope my fellow Texans understand and can find similar bargains from non Texas based dealers.

    <Description>This is a GLOTUX auction; I only sell under this name! Thanks for stopping. As a friendly reminder please visit my other auctions! . For the many events when you want something besides a white shirt try this quality wing tip tux shirt in red! ("wing" refers to the collar type - this is the most often worn style) with pin tuck pleats on the front in men's size 4XL5, which is a quadruple extra large neck size of 20" to 20 _" with a sleeve length of 34" to 35" (_if you're unsure about sizing drop me a line_). Note that plenty of times women buy these too when dressing for a party or waitress duties for example. They are a nice feeling poly-cotton blend that will take plenty of washings, come with regular buttons but also stud and cufflink holes so you have a choice of which to use each time you wear it! Very suitable on its own or with vest or cummerbund. Be careful of purchasing supposedly "nearly new" formalwear shirts that I've seen for nearly the same price you could buy a brand new one - there is often a big difference. If you need sizing help, my pictures are not showing or you have ANY questions at all then please don't hesitate to email me ! See my About Me page if it's near a holiday or for more information. PAYMENT: by check (I just hold for 10 days), money order or PayPal (a new, FREE, online payment service where you can use your credit card!). Nearly immediate shipping for MO's or PayPal. Please see my feedback from many happy winners. I'd love to have payment within 10 calendar days of auctions' close. NY residents only pay sales tax. SHIPPING is usually by Postal Service (very often Priority -- for definite Priority or UPS there MAY be an extra charge do to the extra expense - let me know what you want). Total U.S. delivery charges = a flat rate based on the final cost of all items in your shipment (except jewelry which is simply $2.50 no matter what the cost); I am happy to combine shipments! Up to $14.99 in merchandise pay $2.50, $15-$34.99 pay $3.99, $35-$69.99 pay $5.99, over $70 pay $7.99. Insurance at request + $.85 up to $50 in merchandise, $50.01-$100 +$1.80, $100.01 and over +$2.75. Get 5 or more of these or any combination of my items and for shipments to the U.S. I'll give shipping AND insurance FREE!!!

    <Description>This auction is for a pair of size 10 wide black 3" high heel slingback pumps. These shoes are brand new, never worn, and in the box. They are by "Morfred Originals." They have an adjustable slingback heel strap for a sure and comfortable fit. A slip resistant outer sole and a padded inner sole makes for even a more comfortable fit and a pleasure to wear for hours at a time. Great for the office or dressing up for a special ocassion. For the person needing just a little more room for their feet, these wide size shoes will be great. A decorative bow on the toe really makes these shoes look good. And the tapered 3" heel looks feminine not like the large and chunky heels so many are wearing. Winning bidder to pay $4.35 for US priority Mail to US addresses. Insurance is optional and recommended for $1.10. I cannot be responsible for lost or damaged items once they are mailed, so I strongly recommend having items insured for your protection. Canadian and international winning bidders to pay actual shipping costs as dictated by the postal service.

Winning bidder please contact me within three days after auction closes and payment is expected within ten days after auction ends.

    <Description>An awesome addition to anyone's wardrobe. Are you looking for a fun and funky way to add some flair to that pair of jeans? This is a perfect way to do just that! This is a cute Japanese kimono done in a light blue and black design, with small flecks of silver. It was purchased at Ragstock in the Mall of America and has never been worn. I have never seen one like it before, so you will probably have a near one-of-a-kind item. Unfortunately the picture makes the kimono look more greenish, but it really is a light blue shade. Be sure to see my other auctions for more great clothing! Payment by PayPal is preferred. Personal checks will be held for 10 days.

    <Description>This is a GLOTUX auction; I only sell under this name! Thanks for stopping. As a friendly reminder please visit my other auctions! . A very hot formal set! See the "specs" below... These sleek and unusual nylon gloves will finish you off when you want to look your best and don't want white. I am happy to make them available. They are light, smooth, soft and comfortable with plenty of stretch (they are a one-size-fits-all for adults). As you may be able to see in the photos below they have the three raised chords on top that are synonymous with gloves for elegant men's attire and can fit rather large hands if needed. Also suitable as a light driving glove when wearing a sports coat (or when you just have to have black to match or contrast), these are my finest formalwear and tuxedo gloves best for weddings, proms, black tie affairs _ and a night out on the town!

    <Description>Nearly New! This royal blue cardigan has a V neck and 5 buttons. The diamond pattern is in beautiful jewel tones of magenta, olive, gold, royal blue and black. The back is solid royal blue. It has shoulder pads for a nice shape. It was made by C.S.T. Studio. The content is 100% acrylic - this is a nice, medium-weight sweater and is not see-through. You cannot tell it has ever been worn, but I have worn it once or twice - I bought it at the end of last season, and now it doesn't fit me. It is from a smoke-free home. It measures 32" from neck to hem in back, and the sleeves are 24" long from shoulder to sleeve hem. Winner pays bid + actual shipping costs - I do not mark up shipping. Money orders and personal checks with 10 positive feedbacks and no negative feedbacks ship day after the payment is received. Other personal checks I will hold for 10 days and then ship. Sorry, I don't do ebay checkout or Paypal. Thanks for checking out my auction! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>The most incredible flats!!!! My picture does not do justice to the subtle beauty of these shoes. The pictures make the shoes look cool and grey. They are not: they are a warm cream tone. The uppers are a shimmering golden beige. The heels are a tonally matched metallic leather and the same leather is used in piping around the soles. Just lovely!!! Size 6B. Heels are 3/4 inch including the lifts. These shoes have been worn maybe twice. They have elasticized criss-cross straps across the instep (elastic matches the rest of the shoe). Buyer to pay $5.00 for domestic shipping by priority mail including delivery confirmation. International buyers, please contact me by email prior to bidding so we can iron out shipping issues. If you have any questions, please email me. I take Paypal, Billpoint and money orders. Thank you for your time and have a wonderful holiday season. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>You are bidding on one (1) bar of handmade goat milk soap. Each bar is labeled 2 oz. weight but they actually weigh between 3-4 oz. each. We have been making our soap for over 35 years from our own fresh, clean goats milk. We use all natural ingredients, olive oil, and vegetable fats, and pure essential oils and/or manufacture grade fragrance oils for fragrance. Our soap will last 3-4 times longer than commercially store bought soap, will not goo up in your soap dish, and will still give you that smooth, clean, moisturized skin your looking for. Its mild enough to use on sensitive skin, and has healing properties for problem skin. The fragrances are pleasant, not over powering, so you can enjoy while using it, and not walk away smelling like it. This will not dry out your skin! Try it, you will feel the difference. We can ship as many as 9 bars for $3.95 shipping. So you might want to check our other soap auctions. Our soaps are all handmade by our family, hand cut and wrapped by us. Buyer pays $3.95 priority shipping. For International shipping, email us for rates. Payment accepted in US FUNDS ONLY!! Paypal, Billpoint, Bidpay, Cash, Money Orders. NO PERSONAL CHECKS! Payment is due within 10 days of the end of auction to receive positive feedback. Click to Enlarge Click to Enlarge</Description>

    <Description>You are bidding on one (1) bar of handmade goat milk soap. Each bar is labeled 2 oz. weight but they actually weigh between 3-4 oz. each. We have been making our soap for over 35 years from our own fresh, clean goats milk. We use all natural ingredients, olive oil, and vegetable fats, and pure essential oils and/or manufacture grade fragrance oils for fragrance.

Its mild enough to use on sensitive skin, and has healing properties for problem skin. The fragrances are pleasant, not over powering, so you can enjoy while using it, and not walk away smelling like it. This will not dry out your skin! Try it, you will feel the difference. We can ship as many as 9 bars for $3.95 shipping. So you might want to check our other soap auctions. Our soaps are all handmade by our family, hand cut and wrapped by us. Buyer pays $3.95 priority shipping. For International shipping, email us for rates. Payment accepted in US FUNDS ONLY!! Paypal, Billpoint, Bidpay, Cash, Money Orders. NO PERSONAL CHECKS!

    <Description>VINTAGE BLACK METAL MESH PURSE/HANDBAG The small metal pieces that make up this dazzling purse just gleam in the light. I don't know for sure but I would say it is from the 50's. It has a zipper close and a small zipper close compartment inside the purse.There are two very small places, on the front, where the metal pieces are gathered, that look like they have come unhooked. You have to look hard to find them. I would say all the parts are there to fix it.The inside of the purse is in great shape.The strap is 38"long, from one end to the other, and is made to look like rope metal and it moves with grace. If you have any questions please e-mail me and I will try to answer them. The shipping on this item is 4.00 in the U.S. THANKS FOR LOOKING. I accept paypal, money orders and cashiers checks. Payment is expected within 7 days from close of auction. We will not assume any liability for items lost or damaged if not shipped priority and insured. Created by eBay Seller's Assistant Basic.

    <Description>You are bidding on one (1) bar of handmade goat milk soap. Each bar is labeled 2 oz. weight but they actually weigh between 3-4 oz. each. We have been making our soap for over 35 years from our own fresh, clean goats milk. We use all natural ingredients, olive oil, and vegetable fats, and pure essential oils and/or manufacture grade fragrance oils for fragrance. Our soap will last 3-4 times longer than commercially store bought soap, will not goo up in your soap dish, and will still give you that smooth, clean, moisturized skin your looking for. Its mild enough to use on sensitive skin, and has healing properties for problem skin. The fragrances are pleasant, not over powering, so you can enjoy while using it, and not walk away smelling like it. This will not dry out your skin! Try it, you will feel the difference. We can ship as many as 9 bars for $3.95 shipping. So you might want to check our other soap auctions. Our soaps are all handmade by our family, hand cut and wrapped by us. Buyer pays $3.95 priority shipping. For International shipping, email us for rates. Payment accepted in US FUNDS ONLY!! Paypal, Billpoint, Bidpay, Cash, Money Orders. NO PERSONAL CHECKS! Payment is due within 10 days of the end of auction to receive positive feedback. Click to Enlarge Click to Enlarge</Description>

    <Description>You are bidding on one (1) bar of handmade goat milk soap. Each bar is labeled 2 oz. weight but they actually weigh between 3-4 oz. each. We have been making our soap for over 35 years from our own fresh, clean goats milk. We use all natural ingredients, olive oil, and vegetable fats, and pure essential oils and/or manufacture grade fragrance oils for fragrance. Our soap will last 3-4 times longer than commercially store bought soap, will not goo up in your soap dish, and will still give you that smooth, clean, moisturized skin your looking for. Its mild enough to use on sensitive skin, and has healing properties for problem skin. The fragrances are pleasant, not over powering, so you can enjoy while using it, and not walk away smelling like it. This will not dry out your skin! Try it, you will feel the difference. We can ship as many as 9 bars for $3.95 shipping. So you might want to check our other soap auctions. Our soaps are all handmade by our family, hand cut and wrapped by us. Buyer pays $3.95 priority shipping. For International shipping, email us for rates. Payment accepted in US FUNDS ONLY!! Paypal, Billpoint, Bidpay, Cash, Money Orders. NO PERSONAL CHECKS! Payment is due within 10 days of the end of auction to receive positive feedback. Click to Enlarge Click to Enlarge</Description>

    <Description>These are the cutest "Little Man" pajamas I have ever seen! They were my favorite on my little Noah, but living in Arizona at the time, he hardly wore them, it never gets cold enough there. Now that we are in West Texas, they are too small. They are 2 piece, long sleeved, long legged, footless pjs from the 1999 Yoko Ono Lennon Line. There are no holes or stains. They are flame retardant &amp; 100% Polyester. They feature little cactus &amp; donkeys with little blue suns all over. They remind me of "daddy or grandpa pajamas", the way they are made. So cute, cute, cute!!! There is virtually no pilling on the outside, and minor pilling on the inside from washing. Shipping is $2.00. I prefer Paypal, but please see my about me page for further details of my auctions. Thanks for looking &amp; HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!!</Description>
