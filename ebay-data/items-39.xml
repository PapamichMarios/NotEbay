Big enought compartment to_hold an extra long car... See how the carrying handle moves up and down to make it_more compact?? It is brand new, mint in every way.... came right from the store into our non smoking home...Really, really cute and compact. Nice too, to take to the restaurant and keep a little one occupied. It has a retractable silver handle.. THe measurements are : 10 inches long 3 inches high 2 inches deep.. See what I mean about it being perfect for a littler person?
