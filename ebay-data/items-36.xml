    <Description>These are new first quality mens Crew Socks. They are a Lycra polyester cotton blend Black Crew sock Size 10-13. The foot is a cotton lycra stretch blend that will hug your feet like a glove. The leg part of the sock is 100% cotton. The reason the heel and toe are checked is because the factory made a mistake and knitted the foot of the sock with polyester instead of nylon. Polyester will not dye that is why the heel and foot are checked and I can price them so cheap. ***I accept Pay Pal and MOney Orders. *** Buyer to pay for shipping**.

    <Description>Brand new. By Joan Davis LTD. Jo-Hanna York All tags are gone, but this is by Joan Davis. A wonderfully styled dress with many flowing layers. Has a gorgeous rhinestone neckline. These are metal-backed prong set rhinestones. This trim sells for $10-$25 a yard in fabric stores! Wear for holiday parties, dancing, weddings etc. Wear it to Vegas or off to the Islands! Add silver heels and you'll look like million! See the brand new heels I have listed too! Get a complete outfit at a fraction of store costs! Delivered to your front door too! Although the fabric content tag is gone, I'm pretty sure the fabrics are poly or a poly blend. Not silky or satin-like but has great movement. This type dress is very forgiving to the exact size you wear. It's approx 17" across the shoulder. (hard to measure this one) That's counting the very edge of the shoulder pads. Of course it will fit a smaller shoulder though. Bust area is approx 37". Waist area is 36". Hip area is a bit larger than the waist, as it flares slightly to the hem. It's 43" long. Again, this is new. Let me know if you need additional information. See my auctions for LOTS more, including many other gowns and holiday apparrel. New heels too. All are priced to SELL! Dress is pretty aqua/turquiose color. So much prettier than shown. Take a moment to see all of my auctions. I will gladly combine all items won by the same bidder to the same address, in a 3 day period, to save you money on shipping. Click below to see them. For those concerned, we are a smoking household.

Get this in 2-3 business days after paying! Insurance is additional &amp; optional. Insuring your package is your decision, and to be paid by you if requested. I can't replace or refund items that aren't insured. I haven't had any problems, but need to protect myself this way. Due to my volume of sales and non-paying bidders: Auctions not paid for within 3 days will be relisted without notice and appropriate feedback posted. Please bid responsibly. Please ask questions before bidding. All sales are final,. unless misrepresented. Thanks &amp; good luck!

    <Description>This is a highly unusual piece from Laura Ashley. A SUPERBLY TAILORED black wool crepe dress: a formal coat dress. Soft pleats from the shoulder. 5 buttons down the bodice. No waist. Folds flow seamlessly down to the hem. Full skirt. Dress is fully lined except for sleeves. Stand up collar. The top 2 of the 5 buttons on the bodice do not appear to be original. The last 3 buttons match the cuff buttons and the 1 extra button still sewn onto the garment tag. (See pic) If I were keeping this dress, I would replace the second button from the top with the extra button and get an ornamental button for the top button at the collar. Picture it! This garment has both elegant simplicity and a lavish look about it. Size US 12. Underarm to underarm 19". Shoulder to hem 47". Email with questions. Buyer pays 5.60 s/h. PayPal is preferred payment. Billpoint or MO ok.</Description>

I ordered it as my 10 year gift figuring my wife would use it. She never did. It remained in the closet for years, never having so much as a pencil put in it. It is made by the Hazel company and is 17"W X 12"H X 2" thick with a 2 3/4" X 3/4" Cray Research, Inc emblem attached to one face. Expands to about 3". The two outer compartments are open, and the inner is zippered. All three are satin lined. Inside the inner compartment are pockets for small flat objects, loops for two pens, and a private zippered pouch. The outer compartments hide two handles which extend 3 1/2" beyond the 12" height. There's also a 40" strap with leather shoulder pad that clips to either end of the case. A very nice gift indeed. Still has that new leather smell. Winning bidder pays $8.00 for shipping and careful handling. Thanks and happy holidays. Payment I accept the following forms of payment: PayPal, Money Order, Cashiers check.

If the shipping charge stated is less than $3.50, the item is shipped via first class mail which is normally 2 to 4 days to anywhere in the USA. There is no delivery confirmation available on this and packages in rare instances have taken up to two weeks to arrive (way less than 1% of the time). Past history in shipping tells us that the Post Office actually does a very good job in December, yet with the volume of mail they process, packages do sometimes get misrouted. All items with a stated shipping charge of $3.50 or more are already shipped via priority mail, most with a delivery confirmation. Priority mail shipping with a delivery confirmation number sent to you is available on any item we sell where the shipping charge is stated at under $3.50. The cost for this is $4 and applies to the ties and most of the small ornaments that we are selling. If you want this service just submit $4 in place of any lower shipping amount stated and we will ship priority mail. Express mail overnight shipping is also available at a cost of $13.00 up to 8 ounces (single ties), 8 ounces to 2 pounds at $17 (most plates) and 2 to 3 pounds, $20. This is guaranteed overnight to most of the USA but may take two days to more rural areas. If you want to use this service have your payment in by noon CST or call me at 847-924-8744 and I will let you know if I will be able to get the item out that day. Any questions, feel free to call me at the number above. Please click here to see all of our auctions. We will not be shipping from 12/28/01 to 1/6/02, resuming on 1/7/02.

    <Description>7 Day Auction Going-Going-GONE!!!! Vintage Light Blue Coat Pictures may take a few minutes to load I start all bids on all my items low ..it does not reflect the value of the item at all. You are bidding on a vintage light blue coat purchased at an estate sale. The coat is in great condition, no rips, marks, etc...it looks like it should be sent to the cleaners and would be absolutely perfect after that. The coat is light blue wool with a light blue lining. There are 7 rhinestone buttons that are just gorgeous. The tage has The Rosalee For the women who cares Avenue Brooklyn. There is another small tag on the side that says ILGWU Int Ladies Garment Workers Union 267901 I am guessing the coat would fit a smaller person...maybe around size 6 womens. The measurements are from top of collar to hem 36", closed waist measurement = 21" top of shoulder to bottom of under arem = 8 1/2" and length of sleeve = 20 1/2". There are two deep pockets in the front. very warm and darling coat....I especially love the buttons! I accept and prefer bank and cashier checks, money orders, PayPal, Bill Point, Bid Pay. Items are shipped immediately after payment. I will accept a personal check but I will wait 10 days after cashing the check for it to clear the bank before sending out this auction item. (All money orders and checks must be received within 10 days after end of auction) Shipping charges are $7.99. Insurance would be extra if requested. If shipping cost come to more $'s buyer will be responsible for cost. I do combine shipments so if you win one of my other auctions you can save $$'s on shipping cost. (Ex: if you win on one of the heavier items I have for auction &amp; a piece of jewlery in another auction...the jewelry may not accrue any shipping charges when packed with the larger item.) view my other auctions All international sales will have to pay whatever the cost comes to. Any questions or any errors reading this or seeing the images please e-mail me at susanjp@peoplepc.com I will leave feedback.. so serious bidders only please! I accept PayPal, the #1 payment service in online auctions!</Description>

    <Description>This is a lot of five items. One is actually a blouse, but I am lumping it in here anyway. Deal with it. The brown blouse is a short-sleeved mock turtle-neck blouse with a "Crossroads" label. It is a cotton/poly mix and is size 1X. The blouse is in excellent condition. The black sweater has an "Ivy" label, is size M, and is constructed of acrylic and has been hand-knitted and is in good condition. The light-colored, striped sweater has a "Words" label, is size L, and is in fair condition. It is of crop style. There is a faded stain on the front of the sweater that is barely visible. It also has a single pocket on the left breast. The pink sweater is also of crop style, has a "Fast Turn" label, is size L, and is constructed of acrylic and is a mock turtle neck. It is in great condition. The white/blue patterned sweater has a full turtle neck, has a "Jamie Scott" label, is size L, and is constructed of acrylic. It is in great condition. All items are from a non-smoking, pet-free enviroment. Please feel free to contact me for more information or additional photos.</Description>

    <Description>LATVIAN BALTIC AMBER NECKLACE WORK OF ART LATVIAN BALTIC AMBER NECKLACE WORK OF ART This beautiful necklace is made by an artist from Liepaja. She has been working with amber for almost 20 years and has developed genius ability for combining amber colour and shape in a way that makes her works vivid and delightful. You often see her necklaces, rings, bracelets and earrings in exhibitions. The oval beads trod together make this necklace look vivid and elegant. It is made after the design of real Latvian vintage necklaces. In 30-40 years necklace colour will turn orange. Presently beads are mostly cloudy yellow colour and some beads have reddish-brown shading. An attractive one. Necklace is 24 inches long. Biggest oval amber bead in the middle is 1 1/4 x 3/4 inches. Necklace has metal screw clasp for durability and amber beads are trod on a linen string. Click here to view our gallery auctions Those beautiful and sometimes rare amber handmade articles we have carefully selected for e-bay auctions from our Latvian craftsmen. This warm "sun stone" can be found in Latvia on the coast of Baltic Sea. It is many million years old fossil from conifer trees. If you look at the stone, you can almost see amount of sunlight it has accumulated through those long years. It is rare, but possible, to find very well articulated insect fossils in amber - they look like they're just asleep. This stone change its color with age, from yellow/honey transparent to very old butterscotch. Since thousands of years back people have been wearing amber to protect them from illness and evil, bring luck and wealth - and it really does.

    <Description>As always, no reserve on this incredible bargain. This pair of sunglasses is a brand new authentic Gianfranco Ferre model 423, made in Italy. The frame is a tortoise brown color and plastic. The frame size is 52-23, medium-large to large. The lenses are lightweight, scratch resistant plastic in a gray color and offer 100% UV protection. The temple pieces are monogrammed Ferre in a fancy temple connection piece. These are guaranteed to be genuine Gianfranco Ferre all the way. Treat yourself!!!

Winner adds $5.00 US/Canada s/h; insurance extra. M.O./cert.check ships right away; personal check waits to clear. I also accept payment through paypal.com. GOOD LUCK!!!

    <Description>The WHITE one is HIP, but the BLACK one? "Madonna!" (Finger-tips, of ONE hand, clustered together- in "shadow-puppet," fashion- and brought to one's LIPS, in a soft KISS.) "Atsa beautiful neg-a-lis!" The components assembled here, to form, a REAL CLASSIC, and our BEST lariat, include: petite, BLACK, Freshwater Pearls, handmade, Baliian Silver Findings, and sterling end-cap beads. The wearable length of the necklace, ending in the "toggle," closure is 16-inches. Gorgeous, fluorescent, metallic-colored, freshwater pearls, "Classic," diversity, hand-made, precious metal accents,and a modest $19.00 Minimum, should stack up to enough reasons for active participation in this, NO RESERVE, auction! From the "Intelligent Design Group," @ David Shire Collectibles! P.S. The Bell-cap on the large, black, terminal pearl, is subtly different than the one pictured, but JUST as pleasing to the EYE, if not MORE SO! ATTENTION CONTINENTAL U.S. BIDDERS: PLEASE NOTE WELL: All winnings are shipped via USPS "Priority Mail." The base charge, for any shipment, is $6.00, to cover Shipping, Handling &amp; Insurance, for winnings valued at $50.00 or less, and weighing 1 lb. or less. Add a $1.00 for winnings valued at $51.00 to $100.00 and add a $1.00 for winnings weighing over 1 lb. to, no more than, 2 lbs. A shipment valued at $60.00, and weighing 1.5 lbs. would, therefore, incur a charge of $8.00. Winnings that lay outside of these basic parameters will be addressed on an individual basis. If each shipment was processed as prescribed by each winner, Handling Charges would become cost prohibitory. From our experience and pollings, the above shipping methods have proved to be the most equitable, the most cost efficient, the most dependable, and the most expeditious, means available in the marketplace, today. Thank you for your understanding in this matter. ATTENTION INTERNATIONAL BIDDERS If you succeed in winning this auction, before drawing any bank checks, making payment via *PayPal or any other, viable Transfer Medium, PLEASE, let us know that you ARE an International winner, and from which COUNTRY you "HAIL," so that we can let you know, via e-mail, what choices you have in transport medium and associated charges. EVERY COUNTRY is DIFFERENT, based upon the DISTANCE involved in TRANSPORT. Shipping and insurance fees are NOT EXPENSIVE; for EXAMPLE, six ounces, via "SMALL PACKET," Airmail is only $7.30 to AUSTRALIA- add an additional $7.25 for Insurance to cover up to $50.00 in value, if desired. Six ounces, via SMALL PACKET "Slow-boat," (4 to 6 weeks) is only $6.05 to Australia; the SAME insurance rate applies. Obviously, a 1-pound shipment is priced at a REASONABLE, but higher RATE. AGAIN, PLEASE wait for a quote, before expending any time and energy on acquiring Bank Checks &amp; Money Orders, or arranging payment, via any Transfer Medium. Thank you! We accept and encourage the USE of Money Orders, Personal &amp; Bank Checks but also welcome PayPal PAYMENTS, _Western Union-BidPay Money Orders,_ and ship, almost invariably, upon receipt of funds.

    <Description>2 Little Girl's Dresses. VERY CUTE:-) Look!! I have two little girl's dresses up for bid. The first say's 20-25 lbs and looks anywhere from 18 mos.-2T. It is white with pastel floral short sleeves and bottom. Neck has a large collar lined in lace. You can see tiny little holes where a pink ribbon was attached with a small safety pin, but I took this off because it no longer tied correctly. Very easy to replace if you'd like. You cannot see it unless you look right at it and probably would disappear when you run it through the washer again. Body &amp; collar of dress is white, buttons in back. Next, is a HANDMADE dress in vibrant red. This looks to be about a 2T. It is SO CUTE. Bottice, sleeves, back and collar are lined in red lace. Three white tied ribbons on chest and collar. Bottom has a hand stitched lining. Back zips up and comes with matching panty bloomers. Thank you for looking and feel free to check out my other auctions and check back for more little girls clothes. Created by eBay Seller's Assistant Basic. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information. Payment Instructions I also accept PayPal transactions.

This is only for the box and only if I need to go out and purchase one. Most of my items, I will not need to charge a fee for. I do not add any handling fees.

Credit card payments and money orders ship next day, personal checks ship 2 weeks after receipt, allowing time for checks to clear.

I hate to have to do that, but I've had a couple bad experiences recently, and can't afford to not impose these fees. I'm getting to the point where I'm reconsidering whether to even accept personal checks anymore, but hate for a few people to spoil it for everyone.

US orders shipped via Priority USPS, insured w/confirmation. No bidders with negative or hidden feedback. Failure to pay will result in negative feedback.

She informed us as to the cost of the Kukui Nut Oil and Macadamia Nut Oil in her blends and how expensive they were to purchase in Hawaii.

    <Description>Sukibabe Gently Used Kids Clothes Sukibabe Gently Used Kids Clothes Carters Winter Fleece Booties, size 8 These are great for wandering the house in cold weather. I had a pair of these for my daughter when we lived in South Island, New Zealand, and they were essential for keeping her feet warm in the house during the winter. They are a pair of fleece booties, with nonslip suede soles, from Carters. They are dark blue, with a dark green band around the bottom, and grey soles. The ankle is gathered with elastic. The condition is fair to good, as in they are perfectly fine, but the fleece is pilling a bit. The size is XL, which I am putting at size 8 for toddlers, probably age 2 or so, going off a pair of little Disney sandals I have here. Here are all the basics. I accept checks, money orders, or Billpoint. I will hold a check for 10 days to clear the bank, and ship immediately for a MO or Billpoint. Please add 35 cents to the total for Billpoint payments. All my clothes come freshly washed and from a smoke-free home. Shipping is usually $3.50 Priority Mail.

    <Description>This is a new container of Giorgio of Beverly Hills Extraordinary Perfumed Dusting Powder. It is 1 fl. oz. and has a beautful white puff with "Giorgio Beverly Hills" imprinted in gold lettering on the top. This is just a beautful fragrance. Even tho the plasic is still intact on the powder, when you open the lid it just smells beautiful. This is great to use before you use the cologne and after you shower. You know how expensive Giorgio products are, I'm starting the auction off at a low opening bid. Buyer to pay seller within 10 days after close of auction. I accept money orders and cashier checks only. Buyer to pay $3.50 in priority shipping charges. Check out my other fragrances I have up for auction. Buy more than one and save on shipping. Good Luck!

    <Description>Beautifully-Designed Black Evening Bag Never-Worn. Perfectly tailored, and measuring 9 inches by 5 1/2 inches, this bag is made of a heavy black silk taffeta. The "strap" is also silk taffeta, with a heavy whipped edge, to look rather like a braid, and with a maximum drop-length of 14 inches. Actually the strap measures longer than 28 inches, because it starts at one corner inside the bag and runs across the interior before continuing up over the shoulder and down to meet the handsome knotted fringe tassel, which is actually formed by the ends of the strap, and is attached inside. The strap length can be adjusted on the inside, so the bag can be carried as with a short strap; or the bag can be used as a pouch, with the strap tucked away inside. The bag is about 1/2 inch wide, but will expand nicely (actually to 4 inches, but you probably wouldn't want it to go out that far). The label is "Morris Muskowitch - Made in USA". Inside is a small zipper pocket, and an open "comb-pocket". I'm sorry the pictures are so dark; I tried to edit them lighter; the black is a very dense, dark black. Isn't it fun to carry something with truly fine detailing? Especially when it's so pretty to look at! If you're the winning bidder, I will email you right away, or you can email me by clicking "Ask seller a question". I take PayPal or money orders (for immediate shipping,) or checks (shipment when they clear). Payment within 7 days, please. Buyer pays cost of shipping Priority Mail, $3.50; plus insurance, which is required. Item is guaranteed as described and your satisfaction precedes mine.
