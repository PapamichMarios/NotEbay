    <Description>I have had several Blue Fish Wool Coats go through my hands in last few years and this by far is one of the nicest. This is the Cormac Coat from last years Holiday 2000 Collection. This is made of a warm substantial wool that will take you through the coldest of Winter weather and I might add, in wonderful style. The color of this coat is a mix of light grey/oatmeal and the patches are well printed and coordinate well with this coat. Features of this coat include two front deep patch pockets and 3 odd vintage buttons. This coat is new without the tag and in excellent 1st quality condition. It is a generous sz 1 and measures bust 54", hips 72" and length 46" front and 51" back. Original retail of this coat was $628.00, so the BuY It Now Price is over 35% off of the original price. Book mark my seller list and check back often as I get quality vintage, gently used and new with tag Blue Fish Clothing in weekly. I have been collecting Blue Fish since the early 90_s and have a great fondness and knowledge of the Clothing Line. Check my feedback as it speaks volumes about the numerous successful transactions I have had with no negatives. No returns so please feel free to email me with questions. MO and Checks only please. MO gets next day shipping, checks item held for bank clearance. Payment must be made within 7 business days of auction close. Ship and ins paid by buyer.</Description>

    <Description>This is a really versatile Tommy Hilfiger skirt in a size 5. The color is magenta or pinkish purple, not flaming purple as it looks in the photos (I apologize for the photo quality!). The material is a 100% cotton waffle weave with a drawstring waist. The original manufacturer's tag is attached with a suggested retail of $26. This would be cute at any time of the year -- with tights and a sweater in the winter or a t-shirt in the summer! Length is 11.5 inches. The waist is stretchy and yes, the drawstring is real, not one of those fake ones, so even if your girl's waist is skinny, she'll fit into this just fine. The Tommy star logo is at the bottom left near the hem. CHECK OUT MY OTHER AUCTIONS for a matching skirt in blue! I will be happy to ship both for the price of one! The fine print: Shipping will be $3.95 priority. Insurance is $1.10 optional. Please consider it because I am not reponsible for lost items once they've been shipped... though nothing has been lost yet! I accept the CASH VERSION ONLY of PayPal -- NO CREDIT CARDS. I will also accept money orders or cashier's checks, and personal checks. PayPal and money orders ship immediately; personal checks must clear first (up to 10 days). I do not like ebay's checkout system so please e-mail me directly if you win. Thanks for checking out my auction and happy bidding!

It is from Eagle's Eye. It is primarily navy blue. It has suitcases/bags/carry-ons/shoes/ hats all over it. The colors in the sweater are what make it so special. They are burgundy, browns, olive green, navy blue, and cream. Each suitcase, etc. is very detailed in color. Some of the suitcases come with 3-D gold buckles on them. The front carry-on (3rd picture) is actually a pocket, the flap has a snap to close it. The buttons are gold suitcases (2nd picture). There is too much to mention. You won't be disappointed. It is a size medium or measures 28 inches from shoulder seam to bottom and 42 around. It is in excellent shape. This would make a great Christmas present for yourself or someone you love!

This glorious coat was purchased from the estate of Barbara Dunne here in Cincinnati. Barbara was Miss Cincinnati in 1947, and went on to be a super model in New York. This was made for her for a photo shoot, there are no labels of the furrier in the lining, just her initials (from another marriage) and embroidering on both sides. I would say the vintage because of the style is late 1950's to early 1960's. This could of only been worn a few times, it is in like new condition.. The velvet lined hood feels soooo luxurious on and has a hidden snap for when you just want to use it as a collar. This cape will fit a size 9-10 on down to a 7-8, with minimum height of 5'4" tall...Thats me.....From the back at the bottom of the hood seam to the bottom it measures 48" long. The very dramatic sweep measures 81", the hood stands another 14" and is 9" wide. There are two hidden slits for your arms, with the inner straps in the lining, and one hook on the folded down color, which when latched will cover the entire neckline, I show it open..... In Pristine condition, Barbara had a "Vault" in New York where she kept her many furs. In the photos there shows some white, this was very hard to photograph. There are absolutely no bare spots or drying to the fur. It is as if it were brand new....Better...they don't make anything like this now in mink. Capes are very big this year, along with fur. This is one of a kind. This Russian Black Mink is of high quality, with barely a hint of brown to it, so well made you can't tell where one pelt ends and another starts. It appears to be one large piece...And unlike most " black minks" it is not dyed.. This takes your breath away, and the fur simply glows.... Be the lucky lady wearing this New Years Eve If you see a little red X instead of picture Right Click on it and click on "Show Picture" ....it's " AOL".... MORE PICTURES BELOW THERE'S NO RESERVE, SO BID EARLY.... TERMS BEFORE BIDDING Winning bidder agrees to pay for Priority Shipping Plus Insurance.

    <Description>These are great for those late nights when changing diapers in the dark, no fussing with snaps. Both are sized newborn up to 3 months. The pink one is NWOT as it got put to the back of the drawer and was never used. The other is white with the disney babies all over it and was worn a few times. It has no holes, stains, or tears. Both have the mitts attached so to cover the hands so the baby can't scratch him/herself. All items are from a smoke free home. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>You will love this dress. It fits a 2 or 4. It is so cute!. I wore it 5 times or so and loved every minute of it. The colors are beautiful. AJ Bari has made some of the most stunning dresses. It is strapless and the back has a key hole opening with a bow at the top with a sequin closure. Very cute!. It has netting under the skirt for fullness, but not too much. It just makes you want to dance the night away! Great for a holiday party. I wore it to an awards banquet and a Christmas Party. I have also worn it to 3 weddings!. I love this dress, but it doesn_t get the wear it deserves. It is in fabulous shape. I paid $375.00 for it about 4 years ago!. Please check out my other auctions! Good luck. This dress was my personal favorite. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

Shoulders 17", bust 40 - 44", sleeves 20". **************************************************************** PLEASE, NO INTERNATIONAL BIDDERS - USA ONLY! ALL ITEMS COME FROM A CLEAN, SMOKE-FREE ENVIRONMENT! SHIPPING IS BY USPS INSURED PRIORITY MAIL. COMBINED SHIPPING IS USUALLY $2 FOR EACH ADDITIONAL ITEM. PAYMENT OPTIONS: PayPal, Billpoint (credit card or electronic check), money order or cashier's check within 7 days of auction close. Sorry, NO PERSONAL CHECKS. (Didn't your Mama tell you not to send checks to strangers?) If you send one, I will return it to you and ask you to make other arrangements to complete the sale...and I'll tell your Mama. I am happy to combine shipping on auctions that close within 5 days or so of each other, so please click on my gallery link below for other great items that are slowly making their way from my closet to ebay! Please click here to visit my little gallery of new and gently worn upscale clothes, shoes, and bags. Now for the fine print: Please do not bid if you have just filed bankrupty, have deadbeat bidder feedback, or if you will be making like an elf at the North Pole, surfing the big one at North Beach, ice fishing in Greenland, solo sailing the Atlantic, climbing Everest, manning the space station, or otherwise gone missing when the auction ends! I reserve the right to reject bidders with nasty feedback and anyone I know as untrustworthy or rude. Sale is final unless I made an awful mess of the description, so please ask questions if you need more info. I'll answer honestly and as quickly as possible, but kindly allow 24 hours for a response, as I don't have the luxury of doing this for a living! I take care to describe all items as accurately as possible, but please understand that I do not manufacture or design any of the items I am selling; I do not weave the fabrics, dye the leather, or have a selection of sizes or colors. Many expensive fabrics, especially the natural ones like silk and leather, have small, natural irregularities in weave and texture (darn those silk worms, anyway!) Please know the difference between these and flaws like rips and holes before you bid. If eBay crashes within two hours of auction's end, I reserve the option to scratch all bids and start over again, or accept the high bid. Serious bidders can stop reading now: If high bidder has not surfaced within 3 days of auction end and/or does not deliver payment in 7 days, I will relist the item and the bidder earns bad Karma, a non-paying bidder notification at eBay, and some of that negative feedback I really hate to write!

    <Description>I called it an evening sweater, but this is such a find, a real Diva could strut her stuff all day long and just do fine. This is a gold metallic look sweater with gold circle danglies on the front. It is just what is needed to brighten up you holiday this year. I love this, but I had gastro bypass surgery, the same as Carnie Wilson, so I have been selling off a lot of clothing. This cowl neck sweater by Spree International is copyrighted so if you are a clothing collector, don't miss out. The sweater is 45% polyester, 23% acrylic, 22% nylon, and 10% wool. It is washable and it is in good condition. The sweater is 23 inches across the back from arm pit seam to arm pit seam, the sweater is 23 inches long. $5.95 ships your auction with insurance. I will combine multiple winning auctions for a better shipping price. Please check out my clothing feedback to buy with confidence and see my about me page for more about my auctions.</Description>

    <Description>You can tell by the width that this is not the current trend...The theme of the tie is the General store, pictured at the bottom. There is no company name.. just a loving cup on the label. Very well made tie with a rural scene, an old car &amp; house on the wider portion of the tie, then some solid brown and more scene on the skinnier side. Quite a conversation piece. The colors go with khaki or anything in the tan and brown line. Will mail in an envelope for $1.50 or priority for $3.50.</Description>

    <Description>Absolutely GREAT, very elegant looking mans tie in a gorgeous fabric which feels and looks very much like silk but it's actually polyester. And best of all - it sports the VIAGRA logo. Originally these were only available from detail salesmen servicing physician offices where they quickly became wildly popular as a tongue-in-cheek gift. Best of all, we're offering free shipping. (You pay insurance if desired.) These are absolutely GREAT stocking stuffers. You may pay with paypal and it will be shipped within 24-48 hours assuring that they get to you in plenty of time for Christmas. These are brand new, still in their original packaging. We have a non smoking home. They are gorgeous AND funny and in gift giving condition. Payment to be postmarked within 5 days of close of auction. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>This is a great pair of Gap canvas cargo pants, that are lined with soft cotton material. These pants are very comfortable and very warm. They have only been worn once, because they are a little bit to long for me, I where a 34 x 30 so I would guess these pants are about a 34 x 32. They are in excellent shape as good as new.

    <Description>These two sweatshirts have a lot of life left in them. No stains or rips, free from pilling (champions don't pill for some reason!) and fraying. One is red and one is green (it is not a true green though - more of a tourquise or med green). Both are labeled a size 14-16 but believe me they are more a 7 or 8. My son has worn these up until this year and he was an 8. Buy sensibly..buy the ebay way! High bidder to pay 5.00 shipping. Use buy it now and I'll pay for shipping! Thanks!!</Description>

    <Description>This is a great lot of baby boy clothes, 50+ peices ranging in sizes form 0-3 months, 0-6 monthes, 3-6 months and 6-9 months...There are too many for me to describe each one so I hope the pictures will answer any questions you might have. If not please email me before auction ends and I will be happy to answer any questions or email more pictures. Most of these clothes are in new condition. I see very light stains on 2 of the onsies and one small hole in the seam of the pants of the light blue seater outfit (can easily be mended).The brands are Osh Kosh B'Gosh, Disney, Sesame Street, Small Steps, Faded Glory and Cutie by Judy. There are 3 pairs of little cloth shoes size newborn and size one. I'm also throwing in 3 blankets in used condition ( great for leaving at Grandma's house or at the baby sitters), 4 playtex bottles, 3 rings, 3 caps, One full bottle of Gerber baby wash, a rattle and a teether that you can put in the freezer. I don't think my grandson ever used it!! Now for the fine print...I prefer payment by Pay Pal. Checks are welcome but held for 10 days to clear.

    <Description>This short-sleeved red and silver sequined costume is a girls size 8/10. It has a full leotard made of stretchy fabric that measures about 23_ from the shoulder to the inseam. The white collar joins in the back above a keyhole opening. It has no fasteners since pins are used to size it just right for the recital, but they could easily be added to fit your child. It has white sleeves and a white _vee_ in the front that gives it the appearance of a red vest. The _vest_ front is covered with red sequins, bordered with silver sequins and has a red sequined bow-tie and three large silver sequins sewn on to look like _buttons._ The separate, elastic-waisted skirt is covered with red sequins and bordered at the bottom with silver sequins. The skirt is about 10_ from top to bottom. My daughter wore this outfit only twice, for a dress rehearsal and a dance recital. It is well made and could be used as a jazz/tap, skating or cheerleading costume, or would make a wonderful "dress up" outfit.

It is blunt cut for added fullness and body! It is cut in that world famous Dutch Bob style with an awesome gelled look that can be gently washed out if you were so inclined! It also has full bangs for those of you who can't live without them! The color is a soft black base with gorgeous, chunky light auburn highlights! We take great pride in taking detailed pictures of every wig we put up for auction. The wig you see in this ad is the wig you will get in the mail, although sometimes the shipping process requires that you restyle it on arrival. We do not scan pictures of the ad in the catalouge and then expect you to imagine how it might look in the color that is for sale. The reason is, that not every wig comes in just as is shown in the catalouge ad, every one is unique, and we want you to see it for all of its beauty AND its flaws. No editing and no airbrushing. That way there is no surprise when your new treasure comes in the mail! Shipping in the US will be $4.50. If outside US please contact for shipping quote! Insurance is also available!

HOLIDAY SHIPPING OPTIONS FOR THE USA We ship almost everything using the US Post Office. If the shipping charge stated is less than $3.50, the item is shipped via first class mail which is normally 2 to 4 days to anywhere in the USA. There is no delivery confirmation available on this and packages in rare instances have taken up to two weeks to arrive (way less than 1% of the time). Past history in shipping tells us that the Post Office actually does a very good job in December, yet with the volume of mail they process, packages do sometimes get misrouted. All items with a stated shipping charge of $3.50 or more are already shipped via priority mail, most with a delivery confirmation. Priority mail shipping with a delivery confirmation number sent to you is available on any item we sell where the shipping charge is stated at under $3.50. The cost for this is $4 and applies to the ties and most of the small ornaments that we are selling. If you want this service just submit $4 in place of any lower shipping amount stated and we will ship priority mail. Express mail overnight shipping is also available at a cost of $13.00 up to 8 ounces (single ties), 8 ounces to 2 pounds at $17 (most plates) and 2 to 3 pounds, $20. This is guaranteed overnight to most of the USA but may take two days to more rural areas. If you want to use this service have your payment in by noon CST or call me at 847-924-8744 and I will let you know if I will be able to get the item out that day.

Best of all, this wig is made entirely of 100% high-quality human hair! So go on and curl it, blow it dry, color it, even perm it! The possibilities are ENDLESS!!! The color is a soft black base with dark auburn tips and highlights! We take great pride in taking detailed pictures of every wig we put up for auction. The wig you see in this ad is the wig you will get in the mail, although sometimes the shipping process requires that you restyle it on arrival. We do not scan pictures of the ad in the catalouge and then expect you to imagine how it might look in the color that is for sale. The reason is, that not every wig comes in just as is shown in the catalouge ad, every one is unique, and we want you to see it for all of its beauty AND its flaws. No editing and no airbrushing. That way there is no surprise when your new treasure comes in the mail! Shipping in the US will be $4.50. If outside US please contact for shipping quote! Insurance is also available! We are not responsible for any lost or damaged packages that are not insured! All My wigs Brand New and have never been worn. Every wig is adjustable in size from average to large.

    <Description>This is just darling! It is a Baby Gap velvet long jumper that is size XL 18-24 months. Velour like material. It is a soft "after dinner mint" green, or at least that's what it reminds me of. The picture makes it look discolored, but I guarantee it is not. There are 2 small buttons at the top of one shoulder and a little green satin bow at the top. It also has snap legs for convenience. The fabric is 80% cotton 20% polyester. You will not believe how soft this is! Perfect for fall when teamed up with a turtleneck or any other coordinating top. Absolutely flawless! SHIPPING IS $3.95, PRIORITY MAIL!!!</Description>

Both pair is in not that bad of shape, but one pair the, one in the picture, has had the belt loop sown back on, I almost missed it but, when I was re-folding them I noticed it.

    <Description>You are bidding on one (3) bar package of handmade goat milk soap. Each bar is labeled 2 oz. weight but they actually weigh between 3-4 oz. each. We have been making our soap for over 35 years from our own fresh, clean goats milk. We use all natural ingredients, olive oil, and vegetable fats, and pure essential oils and/or manufacture grade fragrance oils for fragrance. Our soap will last 3-4 times longer than commercially store bought soap, will not goo up in your soap dish, and will still give you that smooth, clean, moisturized skin your looking for. Its mild enough to use on sensitive skin, and has healing properties for problem skin. The fragrances are pleasant, not over powering, so you can enjoy while using it, and not walk away smelling like it. This will not dry out your skin! Try it, you will feel the difference. Our soaps are all handmade by our family, hand cut and wrapped by us. Buyer pays $3.50 priority shipping. For International shipping, email us for rates. Payment accepted in US FUNDS ONLY!! Paypal, Billpoint, Bidpay, Cash, Money Orders. NO PERSONAL CHECKS! Payment is due within 10 days of the end of auction to receive positive feedback. ! Click to Enlarge Click to Enlarge</Description>

    <Description>Did you ever think you could own an Oleg Cassini? Well, here it is. Presented at auction is an absolutely beautiful dress by this great designer. The arms and scalloped bottom edge are lavishly adorned with tiny beads, sequins and pearls. This eyecatching size 10 dress is in excellent condition. However, there are 2 tiny spots on the lower front which I think a good spot remover will take care of nicely. Other than that, it's ready to wear for that New Years Eve Gayla. Buyer is asked to pay $5.20 for Priority Shipping. I accept personal checks and will ship immediately upon check clearance. I also welcome cashiers checks, money orders and, my favorite, credit cards through PayPal and eBay Payment. Thank you for stopping by.</Description>

    <Description>This coat looks like it just came from the store. It is in near mint condition _ I think my daughter only wore this a few times. It is a beautiful purple winter coat made by Sesame Street in size 2T. It zips all the way up the front and then has 2 buttons over the top to help hold the hood up. Also has 2 front pockets that open from the top instead of the sides so mittens are less likely to fall out when the little one is running around. Please e-mail with any questions before you bid. Buyer to pay shipping/handling of $5.00. I accept only PayPal and money orders for payment which is due within 10 days of auction ending.

    <Description>This is a BRAND NEW bag directly from the GAP. It is made of solid black nylon material with a top zipper closure. It has two shoulder straps and still has the GAP price tag attached! It is BRAND NEW and has never been used. The greatest feature to this bag is that it has 5 photo openings on the front for your favorite photos for those you love so much! This is great for the the proud Grandma, Mom, or even a college student may enjoy putting pictures of their friends and family on the bag and using it for books. It would also make a great diaper bag for Mom, or a brag bag for Grandma! You could put pictures in it ahead of time and give it to Grandma or any loved one, especially those far away who would cherish the pictures as well as the bag. What a great gift to give this holiday season. Buyer pays $3.50 for priority shipping. Thanks and Happy Holidays!</Description>
