    <Description>EDDIE MURPHY 8 x 10 AUTOGRAPHED PHOTO Model Color 139EDDIEMUR AS SHOWN Description AUTOGRAPHED PHOTO OF EDDIE MURPHY. During his career, Eddie Murphy has seen both great heights and remarkable lows. He is a true Hollywood celebrity who offers both great performances and laughably bad ones with a healthy dose of scandal thrown into the mix. Eddie was always too smart and too vocal for his own good. Growing up in the Bushwick projects in Brooklyn, New York, he used to stage big contests with his friends in which they would try and outdo each other with elaborate insults. He developed a knack for doing different voices from television at an early age and was the family entertainer. Being such a prominent celebrity took its toll- not only was his fast lane life scrutinized in the press, but many prominent black leaders also criticized him for doing little to help blacks break into Hollywood. He attempted to make up for things with 1991`s Harlem Nights, which boasted a large ensemble of black talent, but the film was a dud and audiences stayed away. Eddie has returned to box office success in more recent years with hits like Dr. Doolittle and The Nutty Professor.

    <Description>Linda Blair at her sexiest best in SAVAGE STREETS(1983) a hard violent revenge flick. Linda looks great as she leads her girl gang the Satins who dress like sluttier versions of the girls in Pat Benatar's LOVE IS A BATTLEFIELD video and she looks after her deaf Catholic schoolgirl little sister Linnea Quigley who -- of course -- is gang-raped by the rival male street gang prompting Linda to don a leather jumpsuit -- quite low-cut -- and grab her crossbow and kill off the male gang one-by-one in excrutiating fashion. An exploitation masterpiece, famous for Linda's nude bathtub scene and Linnea Quigley's deaf-mute performance. On Vestron Video label, box is worn but in decent shape, tape is used but in good shape, plays fine. Approx. 93 minutes long, Rated R naturally.

    <Description>This is the action adventure thriller Judgement Night starring Emelio estevez and Cuba Gooding Jr. Emelio plays the leader of four married stiffs who go to see a football game in a giant winnebago. However, due to traffic difficulties Jeremy Piven decides to take a detour and promptly gets lost in the bad streets. There they witness a murder, and find themselves on the run from a street gang run by a ruthless and cocky leader. This movie is one of the best I have seen. Very low key, but effective, its stars have an excellent chemistry that makes this movie work. Seeing it on DVD makes this movie a winner. Explosions, rooftop escapes, shootings, and an excellent dose of humour along with a killer ending make this a must have DVD. DVD is in mint condition with no scratches or marks, guaranteed. Plays like new. Add 4.00 s/h. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>This souvenir program is printed on the front: CHICAGO OPERA HOUSE 100TH PERFORMANCE BLUEBEARD JR. OR FATIMA AND THE FAIRY, DAVID HENDERSON, MANAGER, TUESDAY, AUGUST 27, 1889." This program has eight pages inside the cover.There are two pages listing the cast and the parts they played, the synopsis of Scenery and Incidents for the four Acts and the prologue, pages with individual pictures of the actors and actresses in their costumes, two pages of pictures of the cast on state. One is Bluebeard's Arrival --The Banks of the Phosphorus and the other is The Grand Battle Tableau - The Death of Bluebeard. This program has a crease and a small tear on the bottom edge of the cover beneath the second A in the word manager. The right corners at the top and bottom of the cover are creased or broken off. There is some brown staining near the E and A on BLUEBEARD and there is a brown stain on the back cover near the middle of the right side. The inside is in very good condition. I have listed a number of Cabinet Photos of the actors and actresses that are pictured in this program and a number of stage pictures of the cast during the perfromance from this production. This is a very comprehensive piece of theater history for 1889. PAYMENT: California residents are required by law to pay 7.00% for the California Sales Tax. I accept only money order, cashiers check, personal check, or BidPay. I am sorry but I DO NOT ACCEPT PayPal or BillPoint or credit cards. SHIPPING: Buyer will pay shipping, handling, and insurance. BUYERS OUTSIDE THE USA: The cost of the shipping and handling would be figured after the bidding so I can get the cost of mailing to another country. Please understand that without insurance, I do not refund money for an item that is lost or damaged in the mail. I do pack items very carefully. BUYERS OUTSIDE THE USA are expected to pay in US Dollars. I work hard to photograph and describe each item. Please ask questions before the end of the auction by e-mail if there is something that concerns you. I try to give this information in the description if there is a variation, defect, or questionable area. Refunds are only granted if the item is not as described or pictured and if it is returned within 5 days of receiving and in the same condition as it was sent. Please be sure you want the item before you bid. I reserve the right to relist an item 10 days after the close of the auction if I have not received payment or worked out a delay with the bidder by e-mail.

    <Description>Bait Jamie Foxx Bait * DVD * Jamie Foxx Alvin Sanders, a fast-talking street punk, is on his way to prison when he's stuck in a holding cell with a dying guy who has a $43 million secret: where stolen gold is hidden. With his last breath, the guy tells Alvin something that makes no sense to the US Treasury agent, Clenteen, who soon interrogates Alvin. Eighteen months later, Clenteen wants to find the robbery's mastermind, an elusive computer genius named Bristol, so he lets Alvin loose, as bait. As Alvin tries to find a job, make peace with his girlfriend, and take on fatherhood to a baby born while he was in jail, he's an unwitting pawn caught between the murderous Bristol and the uptight, hard-nosed Clenteen.

    <Description>ANIMAL HOUSE Collector's Edition Series BRAND NEW DVD! Out of Print! There is NO RESERVE on this auction! This is BRAND NEW and FACTORY SEALED. OUT OF PRINT - GET IT WHILE YOU CAN!!! COLLECTOR'S EDITION WIDESCREEN. The price of this DVD is going up by the day with no end in sight. Don't pass this up! SPECIAL FEATURES: "The Yearbook" - An Animal House Reunion, an original documentary featuring new interviews with director John Landis, producers Ivan Reitman and Matty Simmons, cast members Tim Matheson, Karen Allen, Stephen Furst, Peter Riegert, John Vernon and Kevin Bacon, composer Elmer Bernstein and writers Chris Miller and Harold Ramis plus rare behind-the-scenes footage and clips with John Belushi. Theatrical Trailer Cast and Filmmakers' Bios Web Links One of the most popular movie comedies of all time is also the film that made food fights an art form, and John Belushi a star. This raunchy, screwball comedy directed with madcap zest by John Landis offers a relentless spoof of 1960s college life by following the hilarious adventures of the Delta fraternity. Thers' nothing this motley collection of students won't do to get the best of Dean Wormer who secretly conspires to revoke Delta's charter. In addition to Belushi as the guitar bashing, beer can smashing, garbage eating Bluto Blutarsky, the outstanding cast includes head skirt-chaser Tim Matheson, innocent freshman Tom Hulce and Stephen "Flounder" Furst, along with Otis Day and the Knights with their showstopping performance of "Shout". I accept money orders, personal checks and Credit Card payments thru PAYPAL. Winner adds $3.25 for standard mail with insurance or $4.60 for shipping priority mail with insurance.

    <Description>What an incredible find!!! This is a MINT Souvenir Programme from Broadway's Virginia Theatre's 1988 Friedrich Kurtz/Royal Shakespeare Company's musical production of CARRIE, based on the novel by Stephen King. The musical, which became one of the all-time flops of the century, starred Betty Buckley, Linzi Hatel, Darene Love, Gene Anthony Ray, Charlotte d'Amboise, Paul Gyngell and Sally Ann Triplett. This awesome oversized programme consists on 18 pages, is crammed from cover to cover with colour photographs from the production, and is in absolutely MINT condition. Besides the photos, there are numerous write-ups on the cast, crew and "creative team" behind this doomed musical. If you are a Betty Buckley fan, or after a piece of musical history, then this Souvenir Programme is a MUST for your collection!! Buyer agrees to pay an additional $3.95 for shipping. A certified check or money order results in immediate shipping. Personal checks are accepted, but delays shipping by 7 days until the check clears. I accept BidPay but NOT PayPal. DONT LET THIS ONE PASS YOUR BY!!!!!! Good Luck!!

    <Description>DVD - Power of One - Morgan Freeman Govatos' Just In Time For Christmas Mega DVD Sale! I have 73 DVD's up for sale RIGHT NOW! Shipping is $4.00, whether you win 1 or 73 auctions! All my DVDs have been well taken care of. I am good to my stuff, and my stuff will be good to you! The Power of One is an intriguing story of a young English boy named P.K. and his passion for changing the world. Growing up he suffered as the only English boy in an Afrikaans school. Soon orphaned, he was placed in the care of a German national named Professor von Vollensteen (a.k.a. "Doc"), a friend of his grandfather. Doc develops P.K.'s piano talent and P.K. becomes "assistant gardener" in Doc's cactus garden. It is not long after WWII begins that Doc is placed in prison for failure to register with the English government as a foreigner. P.K. makes frequent visits and meets Geel Piet, an inmate, who teaches him to box. Geel Piet spreads the myth of the Rainmaker, the one who brings peace to all of the tribes. P.K. is cast in the light of this myth. After the war P.K. attends an English private school where he continues to box. He meets a young girl, Maria, with whom he falls in love. Her father, Professor Daniel Marais, is a leader of the Nationalist Party of South Africa. The two fight to teach the natives English as P.K.'s popularity grows via the myth. Maria is killed. P.K. looses focus until he sees the success of his language school among the tribes. He and Guideon Duma continue the work in hopes of building a better future for Africa.

    <Description>DVD - Stepford Wives - Ira Levin Govatos' Just In Time For Christmas Mega DVD Sale! I have 73 DVD's up for sale RIGHT NOW! Shipping is $4.00, whether you win 1 or 73 auctions! All my DVDs have been well taken care of. I am good to my stuff, and my stuff will be good to you! Joanna and Walter are the two newest residents in Stepford. Joanna, although a "housewife" is intelligent and creative - taking an interest in photography: she wants to be "remembered". Like many of the men in Stepford, Walter is an obviously inadequate husband. Conflict occurs when Joanna complains that Walter is making all of the decisions for them. Walter joins the mysterious Stepford "Men's Club", which takes place in an old manor house, which is heavily guarded. Joanna is disturbed that many of the Stepford wives spend their lives in domestic servitude, are unintelligent and wear flowery print dresses. Her friend Bobbie thinks that it might be due to something in the water. At a consciousness-raising group that Joanna starts, the wives begin discussing spray starch and cleaning products. The awful truth is that the men of Stepford are replacing their wives with compliant domestic sex robots. Gradually, Joanna begins to realise that all of her friends have been replaced, and that she is in great danger. Her psychiatrist advices that she takes the kids and gets "the hell out of Stepford", but the men are hiding Joanna's children. Can she find them, or will she be murdered and replaced by RoboJoanna? General Info: I DO NOT USE CHECKOUT! I haven't even bothered to look at it yet. PayPal and Money orders are preferred, but checks will be accepted from bidders with a rating higher than 10, with no negative feedback (There's a 10 day waiting period for checks to clear, so don't expect your item by Christmas, sorry.). If you wish to pay by credit card, or have your item ship the same day it closes, I accept payments through PayPal.com . If you win the auction, please contact me within 72 hours, with your mailing address. If you pay via PayPal, just make sure your address is included with payment. Note: In the event that eBay is rendered inactive when this auction ends, I reserve the right to cancel and relist. Please note that this almost never happens. It is just a precautionary measure. Special Note: Due to the fact that CD/DVD burners and DVD rippers are now commonplace, I can no longer do returns on CD/DVD based media of any kind (I'm sorry, but there are too many people out there who copy and return merchandise). Anyway, this is eBay. You can always sell it again yourself (and probably get more that you paid!). Thanks! Please check out my other auctions!

    <Description>Item Original 8x10 Glossy Movie Studio Limited Edition Media Promotional Photo Title Animorphs: The Invasion Series Featured in Photo ~ Year Photo Issued 1998 Please Note This is a rare, original , glossy movie promotional still. Original promo stills are like limited edition prints in that only a small number are issued to the media by a film studio publicity department for newspaper, magazine and television promotion. It is not a reprint or computer printed photo. Serious collectors know that original movie stills have the greatest collectible value.The quality of an original promotional still is outstanding--even the fine print is crystal clear. Get the real thing --not a reprint. You can own a piece of film history featuring one of your favorite films or film artists by adding an original still to your collection. Please see our other original movie and music promo photos in our other eBay auctions. Biolinks For detailed info on any film or film artist featured in our auctions we recommend the following sites: Film: The AMG Movie Guide Television and Film: The Internet Movie Database Guarantee Starlight Collectibles has been in business on eBay for over three years. We have nearly 2,000 successful transactions and satisfied customers. As a collector for over 30 years myself I understand how important it is to receive an item promptly, in the condition stated and securely packaged. We stand behind our products and service 100%, and we have a 14-day money-back return policy on all items. If you have any problems or questions before or after the sale please e-mail me directly. You can bid with confidence when you bid on a Starlight item. Condition MINT Photo Scans rarely do photos justice. The scan is at a much lower resolution than the actual photo, which is crisp and clear. If the photo appears to have any flaws, such as blurring, discoloring or uneven borders--and they are not noted in the "Condition" box above--they are merely scanner distortions. Servers will often make photos appear lighter or darker--all of our original promo photos are perfectly exposed. The item may be set against a black background to improve the quality of the scan, but the item is in no way attached to the background.. Payment We currently accept: Money orders Personal checks (must clear before shipping) Bank checks Billpoint Paypal If you are the winning bidder we will send you all the information you need after we receive the eBay "end of auction" confirmation email. International customers: Payment must be by money order drawn on U.S. bank funds.

    <Description>VANISHING POINT MINI-MOVIE POSTER REPRODUCTION ULRA COOL! This is a great piece of 1970's pop culture artwork: a small and frameable reproduction of the lobby poster for THE VANISHING POINT, the Barry Newman counter-culture classic. One of the great car chase flicks of ALL TIME. The print is crystal clear and full of vibrant color, printed on glossy poster paper and is approximately 11x15 inches. There is a white border around the image, which allows for matting and framing. It is certainly suitable for framing and deserves to be displayed!!!! This print is relatively new --I would guess 5 to ten years old, give or take. It is in MINT CONDITION. Sakkasan's Attic is not a professional store. We are a family (Jonathan, Sara and young Sam) selling the stuff we have in our attic, and some interesting items we find at craft shows and flea markets. Please check out our other listings!

This set also comes with the limited edition Boa CD, which has 4 tracks including the hit, "Duvet." _ As a bonus I will also include the extremely limited edition AKIRA 2 DVD set, which is in a METAL Collector_s Case . _ This is your opportunity to obtain 2 extremely rare anime DVDs in a single auction. _ It is mint, factory sealed, and waiting to be placed on your shelf. _ See pictures of actual items below. _ Like I said not many of these lunchbox sets nor the Akira tins were made and they are very hard to find. And like I said, both are in mint condition, and still sealed. In order to keep it in this condition the buyer must pay $15.00 shipping and handling for extremely careful and meticulous packaging and shipment via USPS Priority. _ IF YOU USE THE BUY IT NOW OPTION I WILL SHIP THE ITEMS IN THE SAME MANNER FOR FREE! _ Other forms of shipment (UPS, EXPRESS MAIL) can be arranged at the buyer_s expense. Postal money order only please. _ Thank You for looking, please email me with any questions you may have. _</Description>

    <Description>FIST OF FEAR TOUCH OF DEATH VHS Bruce Lee _ AKA Dragon and the Cobra . Based on the childhood of the famous kung-fu fighter Bruce Lee , this film follows the incidents that occurred at a martial arts competition in Madison Square Garden being held to determine Bruce Lee's successor. Was Bruce Lee murdered? Many feel that he revealed too much of Chinese Martial Arts history, including the Secret of the Vibrating Palm and the Touch of Death Principle . Will his successor suffer the same fate? Was Bruce's power hereditary? He was born under the same sign and on the same day as his great-grandfather, a Samurai-master swordsman of the 19th century. Perhaps this was an omen. Lots of fast-moving action with many film clips of Bruce Lee and his title championships are featured in this movie. Director: Matthew Mallinson . Starring: Fred Williamson, Ron Van Clief, Bruce Lee, Adolph Caesar, Aaron Banks, Teruyuki Higa . Violence, Not For Children. RATED: R . Running time: 90 min.

    <Description>You are bidding on a VERY RARE, ORIGINAL 8-PAGE AD SET from an entertainment business paper/magazine dated August 2, 1946 for the United Artists release "A NIGHT IN CASABLANCA" starring GROUCHO MARX, HARPO MARX, CHICO MARX, CHARLES DRAKE, LOIS COLLIER, LISETTE VEREA, SIG RUMAN, LEWIS RUSSELL and others. Superb graphics in this 8 page ad set say it all with a wonderful 2 page ad pictured in scan. NOTE- this 2-page ad is not printed as a spread on one piece of paper so rthe savvy buyer will have to mate pages in a frame. I did with my copy and framed up it looks fantastic. Other pages in the set include images of a Groucho, Chico, Harpo and Lisette Verea &amp; testimonials ads with caracatures and film logo at the bottom of each page. 2-page ad measures 18.5 inches by 12.25 inches and fits nicely in a 16X20 frame. Single page ads measure 9.25 inches by 12.25 inches and fit nicely in 10X13 or 11X4 frames. Would make a superb addition to any entertainment area, film enthusiasts library or MARX BROS. collection. You get them all! up to you to decide how to frame. THIS IS AN ORIGINAL AD SET FROM 1946, NOT A REPRO. Can't be many of these around today in this condition! Buyer pays shipping (ins. &amp; tracking extra... up to you) via US Priority Mail. I accept MOs and personal checks. (I mail when your check clears.) Good luck!

    <Description>Point of No Return 1993, DVD She is society's worst nightmare. A scruffy, antisocial misfit, she's been convicted of murder and sentenced to die. But a covert government agency may be able to transform her into a sleek, cool-as-ice assassin. Her choice: learn to kill on command--or die as the courts have declared. Maggie (Bridget Fonda) is dressed to kill, trained to survive and set loose in a deadly world--where unexpected romance can complicate things even more. DVD is in excellent condition (only watched once). Please e-mail if you have any questions. High bidders are expected to pay promptly with a check, money order, or credit card through PayPal and include $3.50 for shipping within the United States.

Click picture to enlarge Click picture to enlarge Click picture to enlarge Description THE BIG LEBOWSKI THE AWESOME US REGULAR ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER YOU ARE BIDDING ON THIS AWESOME MOVIE POSTER WHICH IS THE US REGULAR ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER AND IS IN MINT CONDITION, NEVER USED WITH SHARP EDGES AND CORNERS AND COMES ROLLED AND SHIPPED IN A PROTECTIVE TUBE (WE HAVE OVER 10 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE MAIL-ORDER BUSINESS SO BID WITH CONFIDENCE!!!). POSTER INFORMATION: THIS IS THE US ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER. IT MEASURES 27x40 (APPROX) AND IS AN ORIGINAL STUDIO RE-ISSUED MOVIE POSTER (NOT A POSTER-HOUSE REPRINT!!!). When the studios started to realize there was a mass market for their movie posters, they have gone back and re-issued several of them. This poster is one of them. It is identical to the first printing done by the studio. Only an appraiser could probably tell the difference. Now, as far as collectability goes, to give you an example - First printings for BIG LEBOWSKI posters sell for about $100 each (if you can even find one). The studio realized that this was not appropriate for the average person who wanted the poster for their wall and so they went back and re-issued the poster in mass quantity and so the value of the re-issues is not like the first printings, yet you get basically the same quality. This provides an affordable alternative for someone to obtain a poster for a movie like THE BIG LEBOWSKI. Again, this is NOT a poster-house reprint. Those are photocopies of the originals and the quality is not nearly as good. I offer a complete satisfaction guarantee on all my products!!!

Jr. From story: Who Goes There? Set In: Arctic Color type: Technicolor Cinematic Process: Panavision Produced by: Universal Description: John Carpenter's The Thing is both a remake of Howard Hawks' 1951 film of the same name and a re-adaptation of the John W. Campbell Jr. story "Who Goes There?" on which it was based. Carpenter's film is more faithful to Campbell's story than Hawks' version and also substantially more reliant on special effects, provided in abundance by a team of over 40 technicians, including veteran creature-effects artists Rob Bottin and Stan Winston. The film opens enigmatically with a Siberian Husky running through the Antarctic tundra, chased by two men in a helicopter firing at it from above. Even after the dog finds shelter at an American research outpost, the men in the helicopter (Norwegians from an outpost nearby) land and keep shooting. One of the Norwegians drops a grenade and blows himself and the helicopter to pieces; the other is shot dead in the snow by Garry (Donald Moffat) the American outpost captain. American helicopter pilot MacReady (Kurt Russell, fresh from Carpenter's Escape From New York) and camp doctor Copper (Richard Dysart) fly off to find the Norwegian base and discover some pretty strange goings-on. The base is in ruins, and the only occupants are a man frozen to a chair (having cut his own throat) and the burned remains of what could be one man or several men. In a side room, Copper and MacReady find a coffin-like block of ice from which something has been recently cut.... That night at the American base, the Husky changes into the Thing, and the Americans learn first-hand that the creature has the ability to mutate into anything it kills. For the rest of the film the men fight a losing (and very gory) battle against it, never knowing if one of their own dwindling number is the Thing in disguise. Though resurrected as a cult favorite, The Thing failed at the box office during its initial run, possibly because of its release just two weeks after Steven Spielberg's warmly received E.T.: The Extraterrestrial. Along with Ridley Scott's futuristic Alien, The Thing helped stimulate a new wave of sci/fi horror films in which action and special effects wizardry were often seen as ends in themselves. ? Anthony Reed This remake of the 1950s classic is primarily a showcase for the gory special effects of Rob Bottin. Dogs are ripped open by tentacled beasts, people's faces stretch to inhuman dimensions, and all sorts of bloody mayhem ensues, while the cast stands around covered with ice crystals and sniping at each other. There are a few creepy moments, but most of them result in another of Bottin's admittedly amazing creations. If you like gore and can often be seen reading Fangoria magazine, this is a must-see. If, on the other hand, your preference is for more subtle horror (or even character development), you may want to look elsewhere. ?

    <Description>Alfred Hitchcock Life Mask lifecast life cast lifemask A life mask so rare it was believed not to exist! This extremely rare life mask shows a much younger Alfred Hitchcock, with his eyes sculpted open by the Universal Studios make up department. The original that this mask was cast from was purchased from a retired Universal Studios employee. That original mask hung on the wall of a studio office for many years, but 'retired' when our source did! I don't know exactly when or why the original mask was taken, but comparing it with our 'older' Hitchcock life mask you can see that here his face is much more youthful, not suffering the effects of gravity nearly as much. His lip line is also much stronger in this mask, showing the trade mark pouting lower lip. This numbered and limited edition cast is an exact image of the youthful face of one of the cinema's greatest directors. This is Mr. Hitchcock's face as it looked early in his career. You can buy from our collection with confidence, we are the original life mask collectors on with satisfied customers around the world! You can spend more for a life mask elsewhere, but why not buy the best mask at the best price? We are proud to announce that Haunted Studios Life Masks have been selected exclusively by Seattle's Pacific Science Center Museum for its exhibit on 3D art, making our castings "officially" museum quality.

    <Description>Halloween II is a new DVD in excellent condition as is the original case. Bought New. Viewed once. Stars: Jamie Lee Curtis,Donald Pleasence... Color/Rated R/93 minutes...Halloween was a breakthrough independent boxoffice hit for writer-director-composer John Carpenter and star Jamie Lee Curtis. It also introduced one of the most memorable modern-day movie monsters in the shape of escaped psychopath Michael Myers, who is relentlessly pursued by Dr. Sam Loomis. Presented in its original widescreen format to preserve all the terror, director Rick Rosenthal's sequel picks up right where the original left off, reuniting Curtis, Pleasence, and writer-producer Carpenter. Find out what happened next on "the night he came home," as Michael pursues Laurie Strode into a new bloodbath at the hospital, while Dr. Loomis frantically tries to understand-and destroy-him.

    <Description>This is a 1992 VHS Five Points Productions Video, still wrapped, untouched, snuggly, in the shrinkwrap, mint condition, boldly autographed with Bobby Allison's signature. I have seen other videos exactly like this one, without the signature, I have few other copies like this one, with the signature, none of the signatures are exactly alike. What I am saying, is, you can tell the signatures belong to Bobby Allison, but they certainly do not look like they were factory stamped identically, each one perfect like the other signatures. In other works, it looks like he signed each video jacket! I am not saying he did. I have no verification to back that fact up. As I said before, no two signatures look as though they ere perfectly stamped from a factory stamp. The jacket cover was created by artist, Tony Comtec. The use of red, white, and blue were the primary colors of choice for the jacket cover, on back of cover is full length picture of his pride and joy Number 12 Buick race car, with Miller High Life endorsements, painted gold. Bobby Allison named this film, High Banks and Fast Turns. On front of video jacket is drawing of Bobby holding one of his all time famous trophies and cheering on the races. This is by all means a collector's choice video of the late great race car driver, Bobby Allison. Please view my feedbacks, recent auctions, feel with confidence to bid on this magnificent video, still in shrink wrap, mint condition. I accept paypal, money orders, cashiers checks, no personal checks, please, nor do I accept U.S. currency through the U.S. mail. Thank you for looking. Thank you for bidding. P.S. I go to the U.S. post office every day, to secure delivery for Christmas.</Description>

    <Description>New Factory Sealed DVD Tonight, they're calling the shots. From hit-making producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Gone In 60 Seconds, Armageddon) comes Coyote Ugly, the intoxicating sexy comedy starring an unbeatable cast of hot, new stars including Piper Perabo (Rocky And Bullwinkle) and Maria Bello (Payback).

Through a twist of fate, the shy, innocent Violet lands a job as one of the barmaids at the hottest nightclub in town -- the down and dirty, wild and fun Coyote Ugly.

Love sex and intelligence The trio which comprised Sublime vocalist/guitarist Nowell, bassist Eric Wilson and drummer Bud Gaugh played their first gig on the 4th of July 1988 at a small Long Beach club (a show which sparked the infamous Peninsula Riot). The group began aggressively touring around the area with an increasingly substantial following, especially among the surf/skate beach crowd. After four years of concentrating strictly on live shows, Sublime's first album (40 Oz. to Freedom) was recorded in 1992. The LP was released on Skunk Records the label formed by Nowell with Sublime manager Miguel and sold at shows, but really started to break when KROQ began playing the single "Date Rape" two years after its initial release.

Sorry scanner doesn't cover the whole ad. CONDITION: VERY GOOD. Each order is protected in a clear, PVC free, Archival safe, poly sleeve with a sturdy acrid free mounting/backing board. This is an ORIGINAL magazine advertisement, not a copy or reprint. It is PERFECT for matting &amp; framing for your own use or as a unique gift for home or office. Ideal to enhance a collection. Many of these ads were painted, drawn, or photographed by the best illustrators or photographers of their day, making them extremely valuable today. Unfortunately a large number of the ads were destroyed each week when new issues of the magazine came out making them EXTREMELY COLLECTIBLE. Wrinkles or different shades of colors are defects of the scanner and not the advertisement. Some ads consist of both pages untrimmed, and others have been carefully trimmed down the crease to insure you receive the complete ad. Some ads have staple holes or a rough edge on one side but this can be covered by matting and framing. CHECK OUT MY OTHER AUCTIONS OF ADS, MAGAZINES, BOOKS, SHEET MUSIC AND STUFF!!!!

This is a 12 x 24 inch black and white panoramic view of the NAACP 50th Anniversary Convention Dinner held at the Waldorf Astoria NYC on July 16, 1959. The photo is in good condition although there is a slight crease in the middle (but you can't see it unless you hold it up to the light.) Also, there are two very small tears on the left and right framing borders. The photo has been rolled and will be shipped in a tube.

    <Description>Cat Ballou (1965) Oscar Winner LEE MARVIN Sig Vintage autograph acquired during the golden age of Hollywood! Signed, with brief inscription, on a sheet measuring approximately 4 _" x 6"; removed from the pages of a vintage autograph book. In very good condition. *OWN A PIECE OF HOLLYWOOD HISTORY* NO RESERVE. GUARANTEED AUTHENTIC Lee Marvin Date of birth 19 February 1924, New York, New York, USA Date of death 29 August 1987, Tucson, Arizona, USA. (heart attack) Biography for Lee Marvin[? Height 6' 3" Mini biography Prematurely white-haired character star who began as a supporting player of generally vicious demeanor, then metamorphosed into a star of both action and drama projects. Born in New York City to Lamont Marvin, an advertising executive, and his wife Courtenay, a fashion writer, the young Marvin was thrown out of dozens of schools for incorrigibility. His parents took him to Florida, where he attended St. Leo's Preparatory School near Dade City. Dismissed there as well, he enlisted in the U.S. Marines at the beginning of World War II. In the battle of Saipan in June 1944, he was wounded in the buttocks by Japanese fire which severed his sciatic nerve. He was invalided home and got menial work as a plumber's apprentice in Woodstock, New York. While repairing a toilet at the local community theatre, he was asked to replace an ailing actor in a rehearsal. He was immediately stricken with a love for the theatre and went to New York City, where he studied and played small roles in stock and Off-Broadway. He landed an extra role in Henry Hathaway's U.S.S. Teakettle, and found his role expanded when Hathaway took a liking to him. Returning to the stage, he made his Broadway debut in Billy Budd, and after a long succession of small TV roles, moved to Hollywood, where he began playing heavies and cops in roles of increasing size and frequency. Given a leading role in Eight Iron Men, he followed it with enormously memorable heavies in The Big Heat and The Wild One. Now established as a major screen villain, Marvin began shifting toward leading roles with a successful run as a police detective in the TV series 'M Squad'. A surprise Oscar for his dual role as a drunken gunfighter and his evil, noseless brother in the Western comedy Cat Ballou placed him in the upper tiers of Hollywood leading men, and he filled out his career with predominantly action-oriented films. A long-term romantic relationship with Michelle Triola led, after their breakup, to a highly publicized lawsuit in which Triola asked for a substantial portion of Marvin's assets. Her case failed in its main pursuit, but did establish a legal precedent for the rights of unmarried cohabitors, the so-called "palimony" law. Marvin continued making films of varying quality, always as a star, until his sudden death from a heart attack in 1987. Spouse 'Pamela Feeley' (18 October 1970 - 29 August 1987) (his death) 'Betty Ebeling' (February 1951 - 5 January 1967) (divorced) Trivia Says he learned to "act" in the Marines, trying to act unafraid during ferocious combat, which brought him a Purple Heart during invasion of Saipan. The body of Lee Marvin was interred next to that of Joe Louis in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington, Va. USA. Son Christopher born 1952. Daughter Courtenay born 1954. Daughter Cynthia born 1956. Daughter Claudia born 1958. Was a direct descendant of both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Was Spielberg's first choice for the role of Quint in Jaws (1975). Personal quotes "Tequila. Straight. There's a real polite drink. You keep drinking until you finally take one more and it just won't go down. Then you know you've reached your limit." Upon accepting his Best Actor Academy Award for "Cat Ballou," 1966: "I think half of this belongs to a horse somewhere out in the valley." Biography from Leonard Maltin's Movie Encyclopedia: Rugged actor who, like many tough-looking leading men, started his movie career as a heavy, then graduated to heroic roles when he became a star. Marvin, a WW2 veteran, took up acting in the late 1940s following an unfulfilling stint as a plumber. Initially appearing in summer stock and off-Broadway productions, he graduated to the Great White Way in 1951. That same year, he broke into movies with a bit part in You're in the Navy Now and two years later achieved recognition as the psychopathic gang leader who hurled scalding coffee in his girlfriend's face in The Big Heat (1953). Marvin also played a rival gangleader in The Wild One (1954), a nasty townsman in Bad Day at Black Rock a burned-out jazzman in Pete Kelly's Blues (both 1955), and Western baddies in Gun Fury, The Stranger Wore a Gun (both in 1953), Seven Men From Now (1956), and The Comancheros (1961). After starring for three seasons on the TV cop show "M Squad" (1957-60), he reached his apex as a big-screen bad guy playing the whipcracking terror of John Ford's The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962), which starred John Wayne and James Stewart. Following the lighthearted Donovan's Reef (1963, again for Ford), Marvin returned to form as the contract killer who guns down crime boss Ronald Reagan (in his last film) in The Killers (1964). He followed that with a memorable turn as a washed-up ball player in Ship of Fools (1965). Next came the Western spoof Cat Ballou (also 1965); Marvin's dual role as a drunken gunslinger and a tin-nosed desperado won him an Oscar and elevated him to leading-man status. He maintained it by heading up two all-star action blockbusters, The Professionals (1966) and The Dirty Dozen (1967), and for the next 20 years gave solid performances in such varied films as the quirky thriller Point Blank (1967), the two-man war movie Hell in the Pacific (1968), the big-budget musical Paint Your Wagon (1969), the elegiac Western Monte Walsh (1970), the satiric gangster opus Prime Cut (1972), the allegorical train adventure Emperor of The North (1973), the comic Western Great Scout and Cathouse Thursday (1976), and Sam Fuller's autobiographical war film, The Big Red One (1980), which gave him one of his all-time best parts as an indomitable sergeant in the infantry. Later films include Death Hunt (1980), Gorky Park (1983), The Delta Force (1986), and a TV movie sequel The Dirty Dozen: The Next Mission (1985). Perhaps his most underrated work was his performance as Hickey in the 1973 film adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's The Iceman Cometh Marvin also left a legacy of quite a different sort: his longtime companion, Michelle Triola, successfully sued him for support after their breakup, bringing the word "palimony" into the American lexicon.

It features excellent photos from the film, and bios of the cast and crew. The program is in very good condition; the only major flaws are a small one-inch tear along the top of the outer spine, and a small white mark on the front cover from where something rubbed against it.

Payment accepted via Paypal (just click the logo below), or through the mail by money order or cash--ABSOLUTELY NO CHECKS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

    <Description>[[ [ MOVIE EDITION PAPERBACK BOOKS ROOSTER COGBURN Written by Martin Julien is based on the movie starring John Wayne Catherine Hepburn PUBLISHED October 1975 16 page B&amp;W photo section I BEGAN COLLECTING MOVIE AND TV-EDITION PAPERBACK BOOKS AS AN OUTGROWTH OF MY INTEREST IN FILM AND TELEVISION. I WAS FASCINATED BY HOW MANY MOVIES, EVEN VERY SMALL SHORT RELEASE FILMS, HAD A BOOK PUBLISHED TO TIE IN TO IT. THEN TOO THERE ARE BOOKS WHICH ARE MADE INTO FILMS FOR WHICH A DIFFERENT EDITION IS PUBLISHED FOR THE FILM WHEN IT COMES OUT. SOME THESE MOVIE OR TELEVISION EDITION PAPERBACK BOOKS CAN BE QUITE RARE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS [ THE BOOKS HAD SHORT PRINT RUNS TO BEGIN WITH, AND IN THE CASE OF OLDER FILMS NOT MANY OF THE MOVIE BOOKS MAY HAVE BEEN PRESERVED OVER THE YEARS.....A PUBLISHER WENT OUT OF BUSINESS JUST AS A BOOK WAS BEING PRINTED ......A BOOK MAY HAVE ONLY BEEN PUBLISHED IN GREAT BRITAIN ....OR A FILM JUST MAY NOT HAVE BEEN WELL APPRECIATED IN ITS TIME SO MOST OF THE BOOKS WENT UNSOLD AND WERE SUBSEQUENTLY DESTROYED] All books are in good condition. I'm picky about my paperbacks so if it's not a book I would want in my own collection ( well, actually, it is in my own collection ) I wouldn't have bought it in the first place. All books are shipped in archive storage plastic paperback bags I am listing hundreds of hard to find movie edition paperback books this week.

I am also including RARE BONUS material: Copies of a LETTER from Mario Puzo to Coppola detailing Puzo's thoughts on certain elements from this draft of the script and the direction he thought they should take (6 pages!)

Thanks and good luck! The Godfather II 5 stars!--Both sequel and prequel to The Godfather (1972), Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather, Part II (1974) delves further into the dark side of the capitalist American Dream by paralleling the young Vito Corleone's 1910s rise with his son Michael's 1950s spiritual fall. To create a more contemplative view of the Corleones' American success story, Coppola cross-cut between Vito's story (in subtitled Italian) and Michael's, revealing how the honorable aim of protecting the family degenerates into an excuse for wielding lethal power, for the sake only of business. Images of Vito's parental concern and immigrant neighborhood dealings dissolve to Michael's familial disintegration and U.S. Senate subterfuge. Cinematographer Gordon Willis's warm sepia tones for the Vito sequences recall period photographs, contrasting sharply with the crass brightness and cold shadows of 1950s Lake Tahoe and Havana. With the memory of The Godfather present in Robert De Niro's uncanny evocation of Marlon Brando and in flashbacks to 1942, Coppola underlines how much The Godfather's potentially alluring myth of family unity begat horrific violence; the film becomes both a critique of responses to the first film that may have glorified its family-oriented violence and a more explicit and mournful allegory of American corporate violence and corruption across the 20th century. These aspects, together with the unique cross-cut narrative, give the movie a richer dimension and a wider scope than the first one's family drama, and it was hailed by most observers as the rare sequel that equaled, or even surpassed, the original. A box office hit, it was nominated for 10 Oscars and won 6, including Best Picture, the Director prize denied Coppola in 1972, Supporting Actor for De Niro, Art Direction, and Score. Years of sequel plans finally produced The Godfather Part III in 1990; and parts I and II were later cut together in chronological order for TV as The Godfather Saga, eliminating this film's cross-cut structure. Often equated with Citizen Kane (1941), The Godfather Part II remains one of the most artistically challenging popular films ever made. _ Lucia Bozzola Go to Allmovie.com for all your movie needs!

    <Description>Hello and thank you for viewing our auction. This is a single sided poster 24 X 34 inches.The quote at bottom reads "He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would suffice. This disgrace to civilisation should be done away with at once. Heroism at command, senseless brutality, deplorable love-of-country stance, how violently I hate all this, how despicable and ignoble war is; I would rather be torn to shreds than be a part of so base an action! It is my conviction that killing under the clock of war is nothing but an act of murder." This is a new poster in mint condition. $4.50 shipping in USA and Canada. Poster is shipped rolled in a sturdy tube via US Priority Mail. We accept Money Orders, Checks, Visa and Mastercard. International orders are welcome, please email for shipping information.

    <Description>Adam is a man whose time is running out and for whom life has saved the very best for last. Ed Asner and Maureen Stapleton star in this poignant Emmy-Award winning Christmas special that has become a seasonal classic. Adam has spent most of his life building up a successful business in New England, and in the process has alienated his entire family: his wife Kate (Stapleton)and his four children. But when Adam learns the jarring truth that he has less than a year to live, he realizes the foolish mistakes he's made in his life and seeks out his wife's help in gathering the family at Christmas, while keeping his illness a secret. At first, none of the children will be able to attend the reunion. Then, on Christmas Eve, one by one, the children arrive for a most touching reconciliation. This is a rare, sensitive film that will be cherished for many years. 94 minutes. 1977. One owner, me. Video is good and box has general wear. Buyer to pay shipping, Priority Mail. Payment due within 10 days of auction closing. I accept PAYPAL or Money Order only. Thanks for looking! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>******ALL PHOTOS ARE 8X10_S.****** Hi everyone, this is Amy from EBAY POWERSELLER CELEBSIGN, I created this account 2nd account to sell strictly preprints to help myself stay more organized. I run up to 400 items per week and by splitting up my items I will be better able to serve you. You will receive your items quicker by allowing me to split the work of processing orders among my partners. Theses preprints are among the best quality I have ever seen and are exact replicas of the original Hand Signed Versions that I have in my display cases covering the walls of my home and office space. Many of these original photos are worth over $100.00 and here you can have an exact replica for a fraction of the cost. I promise 99.9% of the people who receive these photos have a very very very hard time telling the difference from the original hand signed one. These things are so damn good that even I can barely tell the difference from the originals when they are both in my hand, and when they are hanging onm the wall in a picture frame it is virtually impossible. These replicas are wonderful for bars, restaurants, club houses, ect where theft is a possibility. Customers will think they are real and it one gets stolen or damaged it not like your out hundreds of dollars. Shipping is $2.00 no matter how many you buy!!! $5.00 outside USA. I CAN ONLY TAKE MONEY ORDERS, CASH, OR PAYPALL FOR THIS ACCOUNT, NO CHECKS!!!!! MY PAYPALL ACCOUNT IS EBAY7380@AOL.COM</Description>

William O'Connell, Ben Baker, Alan Baxter, Paula Trueman, Robert Easton And Directed By: Joshua Logan. This blockbuster musical is set in No Name City, California during the gold rush, this musical comedy concerns prospectors Ben and Pardner and their unusual nuclear family. The business partners strike a deal to share Ben's wife Elizabeth, whom Ben purchased from a Mormon. But the free-thinking Ben is worried about rivalry over Elizabeth from the town's all-male population, hungry for female company. So he arranges to kidnap a stagecoach full of working girls on their way to a nearby city, and sets up a brothel in No Name. That puts the place on the map and business booms, but competition for gold also grows. Later, needing cash to survive the winter, Ben and an accomplice, Mad Jack Duncan, tunnel under the town's buildings to catch loose golddust falling from the floorboards. But No Name collapses under the strain, and everyone moves on, except for Pardner and Elizabeth. Adapted from the hit Broadway play. Studio: Paramount Home Video, Original Release Year: 1969, Rating: PG, Running Time: 2:44, Number of Videos: 2. U.S. buyers pay s/h of $3.95 for U.S.P.S. mail.

    <Description>You are bidding on the one and only Reva earthquake outfit! Kim wore this while taping the earthquake scenes which aired from August 3 through August 20, 2001! Included in this truly unique package are pants and a jacket! (T-shirt not included) Kim Zimmer has personally signed both the pants and jacket just for this auction! If you were watching the show and/or saw any pictures, you'd know the outfit...well...looks like it was trapped underground during an earthquake! ;) There's wrinkles, dirt on it, there is a big tear on the back of the jacket and possibly a little fake blood to boot! Not your everyday GL clothing auction, but definitely one of the most unique! And what die-hard Kim/Reva fan wouldn't appreciate it?! We've included various pictures of the outfit on Reva below! Because this item is an original and very rare, we do have a reserve price set. Add $10.00 for priority shipping. Insurance is optional. We are not responsible for items with no insurance. Cashier's checks, money orders and personal checks accepted, checks must be given 5 days to clear before item is shipped. All proceeds from this auction will be donated to the Ronald McDonald Houses of North Carolina on behalf of Kim Zimmer and the Official Kim Zimmer Fan Club. Be sure and visit our "About Me" page to learn more about the Ronald McDonald Houses of North Carolina and the amazing work they are doing for children!

    <Description>******ALL PHOTOS ARE 8X10_S.****** Hi everyone, this is Amy from EBAY POWERSELLER CELEBSIGN, I created this account 2nd account to sell strictly preprints to help myself stay more organized. I run up to 400 items per week and by splitting up my items I will be better able to serve you. You will receive your items quicker by allowing me to split the work of processing orders among my partners. Theses preprints are among the best quality I have ever seen and are exact replicas of the original Hand Signed Versions that I have in my display cases covering the walls of my home and office space. Many of these original photos are worth over $100.00 and here you can have an exact replica for a fraction of the cost. I promise 99.9% of the people who receive these photos have a very very very hard time telling the difference from the original hand signed one. These things are so damn good that even I can barely tell the difference from the originals when they are both in my hand, and when they are hanging onm the wall in a picture frame it is virtually impossible. These replicas are wonderful for bars, restaurants, club houses, ect where theft is a possibility. Customers will think they are real and it one gets stolen or damaged it not like your out hundreds of dollars. Shipping is $2.00 no matter how many you buy!!! $5.00 outside USA. I CAN ONLY TAKE MONEY ORDERS, CASH, OR PAYPALL FOR THIS ACCOUNT, NO CHECKS!!!!! MY PAYPALL ACCOUNT IS EBAY7380@AOL.COM</Description>
