Unfortunately, she is deformed in other ways but they are kind of cute...her ears won't stay folded down like the pic, she has a tremendous underbite, her hips are crooked and she has too many toes!

(Example: if 3rd item is $6.00 alone, it will only be $3.00 when added with the other two) International bidders shipping is quoted through UPS ONLY (due to lost packages through USPS). International bidders are encouraged to ask in advance for shipping cost via UPS since these rates are higher.

Due to high number of returns for reasons such as: "bought for my friend and they didn't like it" or items being returned blind with no information, I regret having to implement these terms. It appears there is a high number of new ebayers who are reckless bidding and then returning items. This will hopefully eliminate irresponsible bidding. My good ebay customers have always given careful consideration before bidding and to them, I apologize in advance for implementing these terms.

If you have any questions regarding refunds and exchanges, please feel free to email me in advance or call 702 431-7667. Measuring Coat Sizes &amp; Best Fit Tips CHEST: Take a tape measure and place it under your arms completely around your body with your arms to your side (don't hold your breath), but measure the biggest part of your chest. *This will determine the size of your chest and the size of the coat you need. You can always go a size or so bigger in the coat. I measure about 1.5in below the armpit seam laid flat. SLEEVES: Take the tape measure with your arm at your side and measure from the top of your shoulder to your wrist bone. Remember: your shirt sleeve length is different since it is measured from the back of the neck. I measure from the top seam to cuff. WAIST: Make sure if your waist is bigger than your chest size, wear your waist size or you will not be able to button the jacket. (example: you have a 46" waist, but your chest is 44", get a 46" chest) SHOULDER TO SHOULDER: This is the spread of your back where your shoulder blades are and the sleeves of the coat are attached. Measure from your armpit to the other armpit (you may need someone to do it). Make sure if you are broad, you get a size that won't bind. If you are really broad, try an athletic fit or even one size bigger chest will help. I measure in the middle of the back where the arm seams are attached. *Note: Add 2 or 3" to your chest for the new 3 button jackets. Always buy your height size correctly. Short,Regular,Long Slacks should only be taken in or let out about 2in in the waist European Suit and Sportcoats: Subtract 10 (-10) to determine US size. European slacks: Subtract 16 (-16) to determine the US size. For more Clothing and Fabric Information, please go to my website. Auction Tools for Success!

    <Description>Title: Wild Frontier #2 (Shanda Fantasy Arts, 2000) Please read the description and terms of sale below before bidding! Description: The flagship Hightail, on its exploration mission received a communication from a ship that has dropped out of contact, the Quasar. While on the search, one of the members of the crew is bitten...and then the 'fun' begins! Furry sci-fi comic by Todd Starr, Mitch Sonoda, Mike Higgs, Eric Schwartz. Two out of three issues have been published so far. NOTE! Please read my terms of sale before placing your bid! Details on payment and shipping terms are listed below, or you can visit my "About Me" page (click here) for more information By placing a bid, you are agreeing to my terms of sale, which cannot be changed after the auction has ended. Special Note: I will be out of town from December 23rd through the 26th - payments and email messages received during that time will not be processed until the 27th. ...THE FINE PRINT... After the auction ends: If you win this auction, an email message with details about payment and shipping instructions will be sent to you on December 19th or 20th. DO NOT USE EBAY's CHECKOUT! Please wait until after you receive my email message before sending payment. If you do not receive an email message from me within three days of the close of the auction, assume it was somehow lost in transit, and contact me at matthigh@aol.com. About the condition and grade of my comics: I'm one of those people who believe comics should primarily be read and enjoyed instead of just collected. And because of this, the overall condition of a comic book is not very important to me. I am not an experienced grader of comic books, and I do not make a serious effort to grade comic books (so please do not ask me to give a firm grade on a book). However... most of the comics I am selling are in very nice condition . About half have never been read (got it directly from the publisher), and most of the rest have only been read once or twice. The comic book may show "normal reading wear" (such as a few of those tiny little fingernail marks on the cover that show up when you turn the comic edgewise to a light), or slight storage wear (such as light rubbing along the spine from moving around in storage boxes). If a comic shows more than light reading wear, I will make a note about its condition in the description above. If a comic book is more "valuable", (for example, if it is considered rare, or regularly sells for ten dollars or more), I will make an extra effort to describe the condition in detail. All individually-purchased comic books will be shipped in new comic boards and bags, and securely packaged against damage. (Out of over a thousand shipments sent over the past two years, I've had no complaints about damage in transit!) Payment details: If you have an Ebay Feedback rating of more than 10, you can send payment by PayPal (preferred), money order, or personal check. If you have an Ebay Feedback rating of 10 or less, and have not done business with me in the past, payment is only accepted by PayPal or money order DO NOT SEND CASH! I will not be held responsible for cash lost in the mail. Payment is due within 10 days after the auction has ended. If payment is not received within 21 days after the auction has ended, your auction may be cancelled, negative feedback left on your account, and a Non-Paying Bidder Alert submitted to Ebay. I do make exceptions to this rule for overseas customers, and by special request (infrequently), but I try to be as firm as I possibly can about my "21-day" rule. After I receive your payment, I will email you to confirm payment has been received, the list of comics shipping to you, and your shipping address. Shipping details: I ONLY send comic books by U.S. Priority Mail with delivery confirmation -- this is the only shipping option available, so please do not ask about other shipping methods (such as "media mail" or "parcel post"). I absolutely refuse to haggle on shipping costs, so please don't ask. Shipping and handling is a flat-rate charge of $4.00 for every 15 comic books, per shipment, within the United States. And yes, you can combine several auctions into one shipment to save on shipping charges -- in fact, I encourage it! So, if you purchase between 1 and 15 comics, the shipping charge is $4.00, between 16-30 comics, the charge is $8.00, and so on. For customers in Canada and Mexico, the shipping charge is $7.00 for every 15 comic books, and for customers outside North America the shipping charge is $9.00 for every 15 comic books (sent by Global Priority Mail). Please be sure that you agree to the payment and shipping terms of sale before placing your bid! Additional notes: Please do not email me to see if I have other comics available -- ONLY items currently up for auction are for sale! My comic collection is unsorted, and I can't easily search through it to answer specific requests. For a complete list of all items I have up for sale this week, visit my "About Me" page (click here) . I do not participate in Ebay's "Checkout" program! I will contact you by email with complete payment and shipping details. For all successfully-completed auctions, I leave positive feedback. If I do not receive payment, I will leave negative feedback. Do not ask me to end an auction early, or sell an item at a fixed price. Once an auction has started, I let it run its course. All adults-only items will be listed in Category #1604. Sorry, but you can't pick up your items in person. I have the right to cancel bids on my auctions. About Me and what I have for sale: I have been a professional publisher and distributor of comic books for almost ten years, beginning with Antarctic Press, and currently with Radio Comix and Cold Cut Distribution. I'm not selling these comic books for profit -- I'm selling them to work my way out of a deep, five-figure debt. It's a lot of work, but I'm now about a third of the way to solvency, and I plan to continue to offer comics for sale on Ebay until I'm in the black (which at this rate probably won't be until June at the earliest). I have thousands of furry/anthropomorphic comics, "American" manga, translated manga, alternative press and adults-only comics, ranging from the mid-80's to the present. Many of the comics are common and often available in stores, but some of the items I dig up may be out-of-print, rare and hard-to-find key issues (I've already sold one Albedo vol. 1 #1, Genus #2 and #4, Furrlough #6, Tenchi Muyo #1 and #2, Shanda #1, etc, for example). Many of the comics (especially the older ones) are from my own personal collection, and most of the rest are various books I have picked up at conventions, stores, or by mail over the past few years. Each week, I'm offering a different "block" of items up for sale. One week, it may be all furry comics. Then the next week, all manga. For a tentative calendar of future auctions, see the top of my "About Me" page (click here) . I try to offer lots of related items at the same time so that you can bid on several items at once and save on shipping costs. If you have any doubts about my reputation as a comics seller, see my Feedback Page -- as of mid-November, not a single valid negative feedback! (No doubt I'll eventually get a dissatisfied customer for one reason or another, but it hasn't happened yet!). If you have any other questions, please email me at matthigh@aol.com. I'm not great at replying to email questions quickly (it may take me a few days to answer your question), but I do try to answer all email questions that are sent to me. Thank you for looking at my auctions, and happy bidding!</Description>

    <Description>This auction features DC's 1991 ANNUAL " ARMAGEDOON 2001". This SPECIAL issue is Number 2 issued in 1991 originally selling for $2.00. This issue is in excellent condition. Comic is enclosed in protective plastic with cardbourd backing. Perfect for the avid comic collector or the adventure seeker that you know. Winner pays $4.00 shipping and handling fees. Shipping cost will be combined for multiple wins of my auctions. The shipping and handling is figured out using the following formula. I send priority so that the first 2 comics are $4. Each additional comic has a s/h fee of 25 cents each (this has been worked out through trial and error and seems to cover shipping cost as well as some of the cost I have in the comics.)International winner pays exact shipping cost if over $4.00. No reserves. Please check out my other auctions.</Description>

The designs of this region are varied and are not used as a guide to the origin of the rug. Distinctive designs are associated with particular towns and villages such as Bibikabad, Ingelas, Dergezin, and Husianabad, all are generally referred to as Hamadans. Key characteristics are similarities in weave and colors. Almost all Hamadans are single wefted, a row of weft runs between each row of knots, using the Turkish/Symmetrical knot, with 40-100 knots per square inch. Most of the rugs of this region use similar strong, dark colors, including reds, blues, ivory and brown. Often they are woven mixing goat or camel hair mixed with wool or cotton. Designs are bold and geometric, incorporating many hexagonal and diamond-shaped designs including sharply angled medallions and zigzag patterns, which represent lightening. Stylized florals and utilization of the herati pattern are also quite common. Many older pieces, mostly runners, were woven on wool foundations with undyed camel hair and are therefore camel colored. Modern rugs have cotton foundations with stronger, darker colors, often with bright accent colors. It is now very rare to find them in the classic camel color. Hamadans are considered some of the best values in Persian rugs. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

    <Description>This graphic novel has been in a bag since we bought it and has only been read once. It is in mint to near mint condition and is published by Marvel Comics. New Orleans-known throughout the world as the "Big Easy." But for Frank Castle, better know as the Punisher, life is anything but easy in Cajun country. Promises of neverending partying and easy living evaporate as the Punisher discovers that weapons are powerless in the world of supernatural voodoo and black magic. Storming the swamps of Louisiana on the trail of a drug cartel leads Frank Castle to an insidious new villian-a necromancer with the power to create zombies. The Punisher finds himself six feet under and losing air quickly. But breathing is the least of his worries. He won't need air when he is part of an unstoppable army of the undead...

One half of the outside circle has liquor names (rye, scotch, gin, beer, bourbon, vodka and rum) and the other half has the mixes (ginger ale, coke, tonic water, 7 up and club soda). Point the two sliders to the appropriate selections and you can identify your drink and your host knows what to serve you the next round.

    <Description>This is one of four Forest Frolics Collector's Series Magic Light and Motion ornaments that I am putting up for bid today. Dated 1993, it is fifth in the series and from my personal collection. It features the adorable forest animals circling the lighted, decorated Christmas tree. It was only displayed for a few weeks at Christmas in the early 1990's and has been packed away since then. It was only turned on to show to people but then turned right off...never left on, so it is in like new condition and works perfectly and box in excellant condition also.It sold for $25 back in 1993. Buyer to pay $3.85 postage (combined if you are also the winner of any of the other 3 I will be listing today). Pay Pal, check or money order. Thank you!</Description>

    <Description>Engelbreit Baby Here is an adorable quilt TOP kit using some Mary Engelbriet fabric. I have created an 18"x18" center applique similar to the 4 Mary Engelbreit Duckies you see on each corner. The border is pieced. This will produce a 30"x30" quilt top for baby! All kits come with picture diagram and piecing instructions included. Be sure and check out my other listings, as I usually have items running in both the fabric and quilts categories. I accept PayPal, personal checks, or money orders from US bidders . International bidders MUST PAY WITH PAYPAL First Class shipping is $1.85 for 1 kit; 2 kits is $2.50. Or, winning bidder can elect Priority mail for $3.90 including delivery confirmation. Insurance is optional and costs $1.10 per each $50 value. I am happy to combine shipping on items ending within 5 days of each other. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ITEMS LOST OR DAMAGED IN THE MAIL. International shipping rates are on an individual basis. PLEASE READ MY SHIPPING POLICY and terms of sale BEFORE bidding as your kit is uncut and added to a cutting roster after payment is received. You are bidding on a prewashed,* ironed, re-sized, and PRECUT kit to make a 30"x30" top. Any exceptions to this are noted above. Just sew and go! Similar kits in quilt shops usually sell for much more. You are viewing a computer generated pasteup of this kit so there may be some editing distortion. Shipping Policy Your kit is added to my cutting roster on the day payment is received. My roster usually has about 140 kits on it. It takes me about 4 weeks to cut 140 kits, until I get to yours, which means you will need to allow 3-4 weeks before shipping REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF PAYMENT RECEIVED. You will receive an acknowledgement when payment is received and an ESTIMATED shipping date. Shipping may vary by 4-5 days from this date. TERMS OF SALE * Buyer to contact seller within 3 days of auction end and seller to receive payment within 7 days of auction end, or unless prior arrangements have been made, this sale may be automatically terminated and relisted. * All sales are final so bid accordingly. Questions are encouraged and should be asked prior to auction end. * Shipping days are Tuesdays and Fridays. All items are shipped on the next regularly scheduled shipping day after completion. * Buyer agrees that in bidding on this item, he/she will not commercially relist this item in its original form or purchase this kit in order for anyone else to do so. Doing so violates the terms of this sale. * International buyers please pay with PayPal only. * This home is not hermetically sealed and is heated by a woodburning stove and has a cherished dog for a family pet so you will need to bid accordingly. * Seller reserves the right to refuse sale to or cancel bids from anyone who has defaulted on a previous auction or has a feedback history of non-payment. *Seller ASSUMES NO LIABILITY FOR LOST OR DAMAGED ITEMS. Buyer always has the option to insure an item for $1.10 per $50.00 value. Please request this when sending payment. It is for your own protection.

    <Description>Offered here - a very special item: Of the palest possible green, this bottle bears both a label on the front and embossing on the back. The lettering on the back reads "Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound". The label, which is in great condition except for the very top (see photo) is still clearly legible. It's very wordy, so I'll summarize: 'for PROLAPSUS UTERI - or Falling of the Womb - and other FEMALE WEAKNESSES'. Further down it reads 'for all weaknesses of the generative organs of either sex'. It also mentions that it 'contains 18 percent alcohol (!!!), added solely as a solvent and preservative... Wow! This bottle 8 1/2" tall and appx. 4" wide, and is in very good shape, no nicks or chips. As I mentioned above, the label is still clear, although is is very darkly yellowed. It really looks great, though! I took the photos in the sunlight, in hopes that the green shading will show... I think it does especially in the photo of the rear of the bottle. *** Bid with confidence, because your complete satisfaction is guaranteed! *** Credit card payments may be made through PayPal or BillPoint. Personal Checks or Money Orders are also welcome. USPS Priority Shipping will be $3.95 -- Buyers with shipping addresses outside the US should email me for calculated shipping and handling. Insurance of $1.10 should also be included if desired. Be sure to check out my other auctions, because I'll be happy to combine shipping on multiple purchases!

It seems like it's the few DEADBEAT BIDDERS, that mess things up for everyone else......jeez. * * * CLICK HERE TO VIEW OUR OTHER EBAY AUCTIONS!!! * * * Please don't be one of the people left out in the cold after the auction has ended simply because you were unable to bid at the last second and missed the item you wanted. There's a better way to win an auction, and it's called PROXY BIDDING . Let's say you find something on eBay that you want... You're willing to pay $25.00 for it, but the current bid price is only $2.25. You could take the long route and sit at your computer, outbidding each new bid until you reach $25.00. Luckily, there's a better way. Here's how it works: Decide the maximum you're willing to pay and enter this amount. eBay will now confidentially bid up to your maximum amount. In this way, you don't have to keep an eye on your auction as it unfolds. If other bidders outbid your maximum at the end of the auction, you don't get the item. But otherwise, you're the winner--and the final price might even be less than the maximum you had been willing to spend! Remember: eBay will use only as much of your maximum bid as is necessary to maintain your position as high bidder. Winning was never easier!!! Free counters provided by Andale .

    <Description>This auction is for Three Issues of the very popular Comic Book Series "BATMAN" by DC (Detective Comics). This auction is for issues #488, 489 and 490. All are three are from early 1993. They still contain the comic store price tag with a collectable value of $13.50 and $15.00 (the third book does not have a price on the packaging). I have many more issues in other auctions. These are highly collectable items which are becoming more difficult to find, especially in the condition these are in. These items are in prestine collectable condition, in original protective wrap. These items make wonderful Christmas gifts for anyone interested in Comic Book Collecting or the collecting of BATMAN merchandise. I am selling these for a friend who was fortunate enough to come upon a comic store closeout and obtained hundreds of "MINT" condition, still in original wrap comic books. Such characters as Batman, Star Wars, Dark Horse Comics and many more. I am working on getting others listed, but given the sheer numbers of books this could take sometime. If your looking for something specific in Comic Book Collections please email and I will be happy to look through what I have to see if we can accomodate your needs. These were purchased at a great price and we are passing that on to all you Comic Book Collectors out there on Ebay. Given the excellent condition and low opening bids, this is a great resale opportunity for someone in the business or a great start for someone wanting to start a comic book collection with some original classic comics. Shipping to be $5.00 priority mail (United States only, International bidders pay actual shipping charges, which will depend on location) which includes delivery confirmation. I will be happy to combine shipping on multiple wins to save you dollars. Insurance can be requested for an additional $1.10. I can also offer regular postage delivery on these items with a shipping charge of $1.50 per book. I accept Money Orders, Personal Checks and Paypal.

    <Description>There are 2 DC Comics magazines for _The Official Comic Adaptation of the Warner Bros. Motion Picture Batman and Robin starring: Arnold Schwarzenegger, George Clooney, Chris O_Donnell, Uma Thurman, Alicia Silverstone, and Elle McPherson and directed by Joel Schumacher. The two are basically the same except one has a harder cardboardish cover, printed on high gloss paper, and bound like a book. The second is more like a magazine with newsprint type paper bound by staples. Copyright 1997. Both in MINT condition. THIS WOULD MAKE A GREAT LAST MINUTE HOLIDAY GIFT FOR THE COLLECTOR!!! Winning bidder pays all shipping charges plus insurance. I accept PayPal. Money order or personal check must clear before item ships.</Description>

Two nomadic populations, the Kashkai and the Khamseh, weave the rugs. The techniques of the two groups are so similar they are indistinguishable from each other and so are referred to as Shiraz. These carpets generally contain a central medallion or superimposed medallions. Most often the field contains small geometric motifs such as polygons, eight pointed stars, stylized birds and animals or "hens" called morghi. Narrow borders with multicolored panels along the short sides are also characteristic of the Shiraz. Stylized lions also appear, representing strength and domination. The rugs are brightly colored, with strong reds, deep blues and some ivory. Village rugs are woven using the asymmetrical knot and tribal rugs with the symmetrical knot. They average about 60-200 knots per square inch. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

Great color...flat and crisp but it does have a few tiny stress lines and theres a small smudge (about 1/4 inch wide) on the upper back cover. It's a very light yellow and not glaring.

    <Description>A very small set of owls which I feel sure are from the 1940s. Unmarked, but definitely Japanese quality of that era. One has a tiny chip on its ear, but it actually blends in with the decor of the set. Priority Mail shipping will be $3.50 and insurance $1.10. Check or MO accepted. No PayPal.</Description>

Payment: Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover ONLY Detail: Rich olive green glows like honey from this superior pair of bowls by Boonsant Photikanond. Two flap-like handles add symmetry and practicality to the smooth contours of the pieces. They are a fine example of the exquisite celadon work of Boonsant Photikanond who goes on to tell us about the intricacies of his methods representing a centuries-old Thai art. "...Celadon is a kind of high-fired stoneware where the glazed surface is lustrous. Celadon glazes have traditionally been highly prized and the earliest known was coined "pi-se," or "secret color." Celadon wares were admired for their resemblance to jade, and at their best, celadon glazes may have the look and feel of precious stone. The glazes have almost indescribable hues, ranging from a sea green through olive green, blue green, and yellow green to gray green. It takes me 25 days to make a single piece, and here is how I make my celadon: the clay is mixed and turned in the pug mill and the "cake" obtained is left covered for two nights. Next I let the cake dry at room temperature for about four hours, after which I cut and shape the objects into their specified shapes and leave them to dry again at room temperature for two weeks. After that, I polish them with sandpaper. I then fire them at 800 degrees Celsius for about five hours. This process is called "biscuit" firing. Later I use sharp tools to remove unwanted particles - such as very fine iron and carbon pigment particles - by hand. It's a time-consuming process requiring a lot of concentration. If I miss any particles, they will appear on the surface of the celadon after the final firing. Then I dip the objects into the glaze. After the glaze has dried, I will work on each object to make sure that the glaze has a uniform thickness. Then I leave the object to dry at room temperature for four days before firing them at 1280 degrees Celsius for twelve hours. The final firing stage is considered the most important since the slightest error could change the color of all the objects. The process must be carried out strictly in accordance with established procedures. I leave the objects in the kiln for 16 hours and open it the next day. While opening the kiln's door, the characteristic sound of the celadon glaze cracking can be heard. Three to four hours later, I can pull the carrier out of the kiln and leave the objects to cool down at room temperature. I then control the quality of each piece and polish the bottom to make sure that it stands properly on the table. Only then I put them on the storage shelves." Free of lead and other toxins.

We consolidate shipments from our international offices to give you the lowest international shipping rates available . "My name is Boonsant Photikanond, I was born in 1932 and I married a wonderful woman named Pojana, who gave me four children. I was born in Ratchaburi province and I moved to Chiang Mai in 1959. I have been a celadon specialist for 30 years. My celadon products are handmade following ancient techniques that Chinese potters brought into Thailand 700 years ago; but this art slowly died out. I initially worked for the celadon company in Chiang Mai that revived this industry, 28 years ago, after which I decided to set up my own business intending to market celadon abroad but also in my own country. I now run a celadon family business that I set up in 1988. "The intricacies of the methods and the expertise built up by my family for over 30 years enable us to produce high quality celadon ware and the finest dinnerware in the market. In general terms celadon is made by a method similar to any ceramic but the work is more refined and the glaze is made from natural materials without any chemical pigments. The natural color of celadon comes from the secret mixture of the glaze solution that has been developed for years and the condition used in the firing process. The slightest change in the process could turn the celadon into a different color than anticipated. I constantly challenge myself with five colors: cream, light green, light blue, blue and red. I have barely changed my techniques over the years, but rather have improved them so as to meet people's satisfaction. "I regularly teach my factory's workers and my relatives. I exhibited my work at the 'Department of Export Promotion' and received an award from the Ministry of Industry. I am impressed by the way NOVICA uses the Internet to connect artisans to the world. I want to take that chance to say to appreciators around the world that I wish they would be interested in genuine celadon products. Because the market is nowadays flooded with imitations that do not really use natural glaze, and that kills the real celadon industry, not to mention our Thai heritage that I love so much. "Our celadon ware is made from natural materials. Its glaze contains neither synthetic materials nor commercial dyes." Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Visit NOVICA.com today!

Alluring Mexican design results in a worthy addition to any dining room d__cor. The Lio Brothers of Guadalajara began working with glass as young boys, when their father taught them the secrets of hand-blowing techniques. Here they choose only select examples from their workshop to undergo the engraving process, merging opaque designs with the clear surface. First the artisans brand the desired motifs into the glass before penetrating the design with emery using a small tool known as a pepita, the resulting depth guided only by their honed instincts. "We keep alive the learning that our father left for us, and we want to show to the world what we elaborate." As each piece is handmade, there may exist slight variations in design and shape, as well as minor imperfections such as tiny air bubbles beneath the glass surface. Luna y estrellas is Spanish for "moon and stars."

We consolidate shipments from our international offices to give you the lowest international shipping rates available . "This business was started by my father 44 years ago. He had previously worked in the first hand-blown glass factory in Guadalajara as well as an internationally known glass workshop. It was through this experience that he mastered his craft and gained the knowledge to start his own factory. "When we were young we worked with our father during school vacations, helping him to create glass works and in the process learning about the intricacies of silica sand and mixing colors. We are continuing a family tradition that started more than 40 years ago, and we now specialize in pieces made from pure silica sand glass. Everything we do is completely handmade. "Our process requires sixteen ingredients: pieces of recycled glass, silica sand, stabilizers, flux and metallic oxide colors are melted and mixed using clay pots. The mixture is melted at a temperature of between 1400__C and 1500__C (2550__F - 2730__F). After cooling to a temperature of 1200__C (2190__F), a piece is soft enough to be worked. From three pieces of glass one mask is made, as this is the easiest manner to manipulate this highly delicate material. When the scrupulous procedure of hand-blowing the glass is completed, the semi-finished piece is put in a kiln and fired at temperatures between 150__C and 800__C (300__F - 1,470__F) for twelve hours so it will dry slowly and evenly. The following day the pieces are selected for quality and their unique aspects. Next engraving begins and they are plated with metal or treated with acid. "We export our products to the United States and to parts of Europe. We are also known in certain glass fairs and exhibitions in Italy and the United States. "Our well-equipped workshop has a high temperature melting oven and two medium-heat ovens. We employ more than sixteen workers, each with a specialty, from glass making to packaging___."

Including the globe, it stands approximately 5" tall, and the base has a diameter of 4". I removed the glass globe from the picture because there was such a glare that you couldn't even see the figurine part. Box is in good condition and this is brand new merchandise.

    <Description>X-Men Novel: Shadows of the Past Description X-Men Novel: Shadows of the Past by Michael Jan Friedman Long ago, the alien Quistalian leadership ordered its agent, Lucifer, to conquer Earth. A young Professor X stopped him, but the victory cost him the use of his legs. Now Professor X claims he has evidence of a massive secret Quistalian invasion plan. To stop it he orders the X-Men on a series of urgent missions to three abandoned Quistalian facilites, one in the Andes, one in Central Africa, and one in Antarctica. The purpose is to seize key pieces of alien technology from the scattered sites and assemble that technology into a defense weapon to stop the Quistalian invasion. But is the invasion a lie? Does Professor X have a different, hidden agenda. Normal human Jeffrey Saunders seems to have the answers to the troubling questions of Professor X's bizarre behavior. But his answers don't make things easier, if anything, they make things worse for the X-Men. Meanwhile, the countdown for the invasion continues.... Mint Condition. Hardback. 328 pages. No Reserve.

Buyer to pay shipping (never a handling fee) &amp; optional insurance. Payment due within 7 days of auction end. I prefer PayPal, but also accept cashiers checks &amp; money orders.

This historic document was printed by the Security Columbian Banknote Company and has an ornate border around it with a vignette of the unusual airplane. This item is has the printed signature of the president, Sam Stoner and is over 20 years old. This is the more desirable 100 share certificate. Certificate Vignette This unusual airplane has engines and scooped out portions on the wings to help it in the vertical climb. The idea behiond the palne was to take off straight up in the sky. Unfortunately the idea never took off (sorry) and only one Custer Channel Wing was ever built and it resides in a museum in Reading, Pennsylvania. The company Charter was forfeited on 10/3/94 for failure to file annual reports, but it was really out of business long before.

Measures 5 inches high by 3 1/4 inches wide and is folded like a greeting card. Maybe was a novelty item or souvenir? On the cover it says "Reward, for the apprehension and arrest of this man"...then there is a cut out shape of a man"s head with green cellephane in the back of it. On the bottom it says, "Beware...He is still at large! Unmask this man See description inside". When you open it, it reveals a picture of a pig, a snake, a rat and a skunk. And says: "Unmasked! He"s a pig, he"s a snake, a rat and a skunk!, He"s a fifth columnist!" The different parts of the animals bodies that showed through the cut out on the cover make up the mans face. On the back of the cover it says: No 745 Fifth Columnist, 1940 H. Fishglove &amp; Co. Reg. U.S. Pat Off., Made in Chicago U.S.A., Instringents will be prosecuted.

    <Description>Wild Black Baggy Paco Jean Co Cargo Jeans! These are some cool jeans! Up for auction is an authentic pair of Paco cargo jeans with cool embroidery on one cargo pocket and Paco Jean Co Est. 1989 embroidered on the back pocket! This piece is in excellent condition-very gently worn with minor wear! They are size 34W and 34L. ENJOY! Please read before bidding ( esp. the stuff in red! ): The pics speak for themselves in this case. It may take a moment to load, but stick around because it's worth it! Please note, all measurements and available tag sizes are included, please be sure to know your size. We cannot be responsible for items that do not fit you, as we do not know your measurements. We have included several images so please be patient. Check our other auctions for even more wild vintage clothing. We carry swing, mod, hippie, rockabilly, lounge, swank, rave, gothic... if you can name it, chances are we've got it! As with all vintage clothes, some wear is to be expected. Unless the description says "MINT," there may be some wear that comes naturally with age. On the other hand, we take all steps to sell only premium items, and should there be any marks, rips or stains, we take every precaution to let you know either in the text or with photos. Bid with confidence- check our feedback! Feel free to email if you have any questions, we re here to help. And don't forget, kids: T-Bone takes Pay Pal! Due to the high cost of international shipping, if you are a non-US bidder we are forced to require a US Money Order (or good old Pay Pal!) and we must re-calculate the shipping prior to payment. US shipping will be $6.00. We can no longer ship any other way than USPS Priority within the US. Priority mail allows for delivery confirmation (which really covers both the seller AND the buyer). Because we must rely on delivery confirmation for verification, we cannot deviate from this policy. This auction is for serious bidders only. Please do not bid on this item if funds are not available for immediate payment. People with overwhelmingly negative feedback are asked not to bid. We will remove these negative bidders from our auctions at our discretion. If payment is not received within ten days from end of auction bidders will be given a negative feedback, be reported to eBay as deadbeat bidder and be removed from any of our auctions. NO RESERVE Buyer to pay $6.00 for shipping and handling. Please click here to see my other auctions. Created by eBay Seller's Assistant Pro</Description>

The original tag price of $28.00 is still intact. The box reads, "Keepsake Ornament, hear 4 messages from Santa", "Conversations With Santa, Motion and Voice, Magic". At the back of the box reads, "Handcrafted - Dated 1994", "Limited Warranty Through 1997 Enclosed", "Santa has a lot to say - especially at Christmas. He's very expressive, so you'll see his moustache move as he brings you four jolly messages in sequential order". It also has instructions on how to start and operate the gadget. Attached connector cord allows for easy placement on your tree. A complete display instruction sheet is included. At the back is marked, "1994" and "1994 Hallmark Cards, Inc., US Pat. No. 4682079". Buyer pays $4 shipping and handling if shipped within the United States. I will combine shipping for multiple purchases. Personal checks, money orders, Billpoint and PayPal are ok.

    <Description>I have a very large group of shakers up for auction starting with this unusual set. Never used, only displayed. Aged patina evident on both. Marked Japan on the bottom. Photo says it all. From my mothers collection of many years. All need new homes as I have no room. Many shakers were given as new, others were found used and presented as a momento of a trip. I can't give you age, mfg or origin. You be the judge. With a very wide variety of companions, there are sure to be plenty to please that collector on your list. I will be happy to combine winning bids to save postage. Please ask any questions, as ALL SALES ARE FINAL. Payment methods: Pay Pal (preferred), money orders, and cashier checks. These payments get next business day shipment. Seven day delay on personal checks. Buyer pays actual shipping with insurance and delivery confirmation. I ship priority mail. Thank you for your interest in my auction. Good luck with your bid.</Description>

The cornerstone of the chapel was laid on September 7, 1936. The first service was held almost a year later on September 19, 1937 and the chapel were dedicated on April 10, 1938 as the Cadet Chapel. After General Summerall's retirement as president of the Citadels in June of 1953, the name was officially changed to the General Charles Pelot Summerall Chapel. All of the stained glass was designed at a single studio and consequently is concordant throughout. The woodwork was designed in the style of fourteenth century Gothic and the lighting fixtures are handmade of wrought iron. On the left rear of the chapel grounds is the Thomas Dry Memorial Carillon which houses one of the Western Hemisphere's largest Dutch Bell installations. It was dedicated to the memory of Major Thomas Dry Howie, class of 1929 who was killed in action during World War II on July 17, 1944. -----This is made of wood and painted by Sheila's. It stands 5 1/2 inches tall and 7 1/2 inches wide. It has a dimension that "puts you there" !!! It comes in the original box..

    <Description>Bathroom Buddies - 66 card set If you like the Garbage Pail Kids, then you'll love this Bathroom Buddies set. But you don't have to take my word for it. Below is a scan of 12 of the cards in the set. The cards were made in the United States by Topps in 1996. This is a COMPLETE 66 card set (1a-33a, 1b-33b). Each card has a twin just like the Garbage Pail Kids. There are no known variations for this set. All the cards are in NEAR MINT - MINT condition. Note: There were two Bathroom Buddies sets made by Topps: a 44 card set and a 66 card set. The fronts of cards 1a-22a and 1b-22b are the same for both sets. The backs of all but 2 of the cards are the same for both sets. The two different cards are the checklist cards for the 44 card set. I have both of these sets listed for sale on ebay, so please see my other ebay auctions. You will also get one Garbage Pail Kids card with this set. BONUS: 10 - Bathroom Buddies wrappers!

It has Santa coming down the chimney made of Legos with milk and cookies waiting for him. It's hard to get one of these, but both at the same time is nice!! These are BRAND NEW and mint in near mint boxes with only very minor shelfwear. Buyer to pay $4.60 for Insured Priority Mail to the US ONLY, I do not ship internationaly at this time.

    <Description>These are from the 1950s or 60s. They are brass flatware from Thailand sold for export. They have a design of a Hindu or Buddhist figure and the words Siam on the ends. The little box has mostly handles that feel like plastic, though some are definitely wood so maybe they all are, just something funny. The bigger box, those all seem to be some sort of wood handles. Those handles are connected to the bronze parts by some sort of rivet and a few are a little loose and I think one is broken. Mostly they are in good shape, could use a light cleaning and they have some light wear in spots. Generally they are in good condition. The bigger box has pieces marked on the back BB Siam, the little boxes they don't have that mark. The little box has a label from Joe's Jewelry in Bangkok Thailand, the bigger box from Siam. The designs are somewhat similar, just a little bit of difference but mostly alike. There are lots of forks, spoons, knives, and serving pieces - a total of 78 I think we counted. The boxes really aren't that special, they have wear to them as well. The total weight will be about 18 pounds so the further you are away from Washington State the more shipping will be. The high bidder is to pay for the postage or UPS costs (we don't charge handling) and you can pay with cash, a check, money order or paypal and have a full refund if needed. Good Luck!

    <Description>Lot deal of 6 TheShadow Comics ranging from 1973 to 1975. This is the last box I discovered in my shed hiding with the lost socks from the washer! I listed hundreds of these this summer and thought I was done, but... They've got to go! These are in better condition, still with yellowing from age, musty smell from storage, a few have dog ears, light wear on edges ...etc. If you need further details on a particular one please e-mail me, I'm about out of steam to describe each and everyone! Here is what you get: ** 1973: #1 (marked 1st DC issue) ** 1974: # 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 ** 1975: #12 CONDITION: again, they are not perfect and I'm not a comic book expert and grader, I would grade these as fair, with some better than others.
