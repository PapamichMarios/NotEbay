    <Description>Vintage Mirro Cookie-Pastry Press W/Recipes This is a vintage Mirro brand cookie-pastry press in the original box with recipes. You are getting the aluminum press, 12 cookie plates and 3 pastry tips, and an instruction/recipe book. This is in very good condition -- looks like it was never used. All the pieces fit down into a styrofoam base and there is a box bottom only -- I think a lid of some type is missing, but the base fits over the styrofoam. If you are planning to make holiday Spritz cookies -- this is just what you need! NO RESERVE! Buyer agrees by bidding to pay $5.20 for shipping in the U.S. Most likely, the shipping quote is priority mail through the USPS, but I also use first class, or media mail if appropriate. Insurance is optional at $1.10 for the first $50. coverage. If you opt to not have insurance it is understood that you are shipping at your own risk. If I have not given a quote above it is because this weighs more than 5 lbs. wrapped and the costs vary depending on where you live -- You can get an exact quote by going to the postal website at www.usps.gov -- my zip code is 48167. I cannot ship UPS. International rates will be higher -- write me for a quote before you bid if you are concerned about the cost. Bid on more than one item to save shipping costs!! ALL THE FINE PRINT: Personal checks, money orders, PayPal, Billpoint or Bidpay are accepted. I make every effort to ship as soon as possible with any type of payment. Since I list a wide variety of collectibles, I can't be an expert on everything. I do try to be as accurate as possible in my item descriptions, but I may inadvertently leave out some information because I'm not that familiar with a particular piece. If you have any questions, please feel free to e-mail me. Thank you for looking!! Michigan residents must pay 6% sales tax or provide me with your tax ID#.

    <Description>Green roof. Straight from a dealers shelf. Sleeve has a few small holes in it (maybe you can see from the picture). Taken out for pictures, inspection, and to check the operation of the electronics. I accept Paypal, Ebay payments, money orders, or personal checks. Checks will have to clear before item ships(usually 7 days from the day I receive it). All other forms of payment will ship immediately. I ship by priority mail unless the buyer wants some other form. Shipping with insurance will be $12 to the lower 48. Other locations will be at actual cost. I will be listing many Dept 56 and Snow Village items this weekend, all starting at 99 cents with no reserve! Take a look and maybe there_s something you can use. Thanks</Description>

The cover features Avengers leader CAPTAIN AMERICA (with art by DC artist Kevin Maguire). With this radio station ad script kit, Marvel encouraged retailers to create their own co-op advertisements for on-the-air radio broadcasting spots, and these scripts were designed as a fun way for comic books stores to perform and record their radio ads "the Marvel Way". The scripts in this booklet promoted titles such as the Amazing Spider-man, Capt America, the Silver Surfer, Daredevil, the Avengers, Ghost Rider, Conan the Barbarian, the Uncanny X-Men, the Incredible Hulk, the Fantastic Four, etc. This extremely RARE Marvel artifact came out in 1992, and was sent absolutely, strictly, to comic book retail shops to boost sales of trade paperback &amp; graphic novel releases, comic books, etc. This item is in UNUSED NEAR MINT condition.

A plimsol line with numerical markings runs down the belly of one of them, a representation of the amount of oil that can be extracted from an elephant seal. Peter carved the cigarette lighter under the other seal s flipper after a beach-combing trip in North Wales where he found the beach littered with plastic lighters. Peter s mouse looks out startled from under another flipper. The inspiration for the rat carved inside was a topical news item that Peter misheard on the radio at the time of carving: the monster rat catastrophe. It turns out that it was the Montserrat catastrophe, a volcano threatening to erupt in the Caribbean. Hallmarks include , heart, HBC logo, ed.#, and Pc, with "P. Calvesbert" on the base. 1ST EDITION, NEVER DISPLAYED. THIS BOX WAS FROM THE FIRST RELEASE AND THE NOSE OF THE MOUSE INSIDE IS RED. THE FLIPPERS OF THE SEA LION ARE GREY.

    <Description>NO RESERVE! This is a HUGE Stemware Goblet that measures 11" high and 7" across top opening. This may have been a Dusty Bottle Special Fraternity Goblet. Before any real Toga party....the goblet is filled with a shot from any and every Dusty bottle on the bar.......and then things started happening. Or maybe you would call it a Big Ol' Beer (Wine) Swillin' Deal. It would look great on your bar filled with peanuts, etc., or could be used as a trifle style serving glass. Or turn the letters to the back and fill with Christmas ornaments.. Use your imagination.. It has 3 Greek letters etched on the side that stand for Alpha Epsilon Phi. Condition is excellent. Really a very pretty glass. TERMS Winner to confirm their bid by furnishing your mailing address within 3 business days. Payment is bid amount plus Actual Priority Shipping charges. Please mail payment within 10 days of auction end. Insurance is your option. I do package carefully, but it's your choice. I do not charge a handling fee and will not hold your check to clear. I will mail all orders the first business day after receipt of payment by check, money order, or Sacajewea dollars. :^) I will also accept Paypal for bids over $10.00. I welcome international bidders, but shipping will be higher. You can wait until end of auction or you can email me for quote. Multiple orders can be combined when practical to save on shipping. All questions welcome. Good luck and happy trading. GOD BLESS AMERICA !</Description>

Here we have two issues from that classic horror series from the 70's, Ghosts. # 19 &amp; 13 are both in FN to VF condition and ready to add to your ghostly collection. Please see shipping costs/methods and insurance requirements below. For larger items please click here to email us for a quote. All breakables and items valued near and above $50 will have insurance required. If the item is shipped via FedEx this coverage is automatic up to $100 in value, 40_ for each additional $100 coverage. For USPS delivery, $1.25 up to $50, $1.00 each additional $100. All uninsured parcels become the responsiblity of the bidder once said parcel is duly delivered to the appropriate carrier. The following types of payment are accepted: money orders, personal checks*, and all major credit cards. Payment must be received within 10 business days in order to avoid negative feedback and being reported to eBay as a non-payer. This will also expedite shipping of your item. * All returned checks will be accessed a $25 service fee. Buyer to pay $2.50 for shipping and handling. All international bidders MUST email us for an adjusted S&amp;H quote! Click here to view my other auctions. Ma residents pay a 5% sales tax. SHIPPING METHODS: The bidder may at any time request the shipping service of their choice, to which will be added an appropriate handling fee. MEDIA: We have been shipping media items (records, books, etc.) by Media mail, but have experienced slow delivery times, so we are trying to move away from this service. Smaller, light-weight media items over 13 ozs. are still quoted for Media mail and the bidder may request a different delivery service. However, we WILL NOT be held responsible for the long amount of time any Media mail shipment may take. SMALLER ITEMS: Other smaller items up to 13 ozs. are shipped first class. All other items are shipped either Priority mail or FedEx. Usually anything over a few pounds is shipped via FedEx, hence the higher costs. However, their exemplary service is guarenteed, carries automatic insurance up to $100 in value, and is trackable with out additional cost. Any item shipped through the USPS Priority service without requesting additional services such as delivery confirmation can not be tracked, nor will we be held responsibility for its not being delivered (see insurance disclaimer above). LARGER ITEMS: Larger items such as furniture and such are shipped either with BAX Global or a local mover we use who makes east coast runs every two-three weeks. HANDLING FEES: Since our shipping department needs to eat (and we require him to wear shoes, please! ), and shipping materials do cost money (really!) all items have an appropriate handling fee. Basically, the more time and care taken to prepare an item for safe transport, the higher the fee. We do our best to provide both cost effective and careful handling of packaging your item. This fee is not negotiable is usually reflected in all posted S&amp;H charges, or added to shipping quotes for larger items.

All uninsured parcels become the responsiblity of the bidder once said parcel is duly delivered to the appropriate carrier. DELIVERY CAN BE MADE WITHIN A 250 MILE RADIUS OF OUR STORE ON OUR LARGER ITEMS. PLEASE EMAIL FOR A DELIVERY QUOTE The following types of payment are accepted: money orders, personal checks*, and all major credit cards. Payment must be received within 10 business days in order to avoid negative feedback and being reported to eBay as a non-payer. This will also expedite shipping of your item. * All returned checks will be accessed a $25 service fee. Ma residents pay a 5% sales tax. SHIPPING METHODS: The bidder may at any time request the shipping service of their choice, to which will be added an appropriate handling fee. MEDIA: We have been shipping media items (records, books, etc.) by Media mail, but have experienced slow delivery times, so we are trying to move away from this service. Smaller, light-weight media items over 13 ozs. are still quoted for Media mail and the bidder may request a different delivery service. However, we WILL NOT be held responsible for the long amount of time any Media mail shipment may take. SMALLER ITEMS: Other smaller items up to 13 ozs. are shipped first class. All other items are shipped either Priority mail or FedEx. Usually anything over a few pounds is shipped via FedEx, hence the higher costs. However, their exemplary service is guarenteed, carries automatic insurance up to $100 in value, and is trackable with out additional cost. Any item shipped through the USPS Priority service without requesting additional services such as delivery confirmation can not be tracked, nor will we be held responsibility for its not being delivered (see insurance disclaimer above). LARGER ITEMS: Larger items such as furniture and such are shipped either with BAX Global or a local mover we use who makes east coast runs every two-three weeks. HANDLING FEES: Since our shipping department needs to eat (and we require him to wear shoes, please! ), and shipping materials do cost money (really!) all items have an appropriate handling fee. Basically, the more time and care taken to prepare an item for safe transport, the higher the fee. We do our best to provide both cost effective and careful handling of packaging your item. This fee is not negotiable and is usually reflected in all posted S&amp;H charges, or added to shipping quotes for larger items.

I built up a 550+ feedback rating while working with Socko! Comics. Now I am starting over on my own, but that means starting with a feedback of zero. Read my Honesty Policy below. NM 1970 ASTONISHING TALES 1 - 8 : KAZAR &amp; DR DOOM QUESTIONS: click here to send an e-mail CONDITION : NEAR MINT OPENING BID: $9.99 HOW TO PAY? MONEY ORDER &amp; PAYPAL HOW TO SHIP? I ship via United States Postal Service for both domestic and international. You pay only the cost required to ship. I do not believe in padding auctions by adding unjustified extra charges. I don't like it when people do it to me, so I won't do it to you. PICTURES: Click on each to get a larger view. _ #1 #7 HONESTY POLICY I have met people in my store who won books on E-Bay that were nowhere near the condition described. It angers me as a seller because it ruins the reputations of dealers as a whole. Simply put, it hurts our market by driving away customers. How Do I Grade? I look at every book and grade it according to six categories: front cover, back cover, corners, edges, spine &amp; staples, interior pages. I give a complete description of each of these sections noting any flaws or defects. Also, I include large scans of the front and back covers. When I have completed the auction page, I am satisfied that you know exactly what you are bidding on and that there will be no surprises at auction's end. So what about returns? At first I offered returns on books. Then I quickly discovered that some people would outbid everyone else by an excessively high amount just to get a look at the book, then ask for a return if they decided they didn't want it. I no longer offer returns. I am confident in my grading and description and have never had a complaint about either. If you are not sure that you want the book then don't bid on it. COMPLETE DESCRIPTION: _ All books have come from the same collection and have received the same care over the years. Title: Astonishing Tales Featuring Kazar and Dr. Doom Issue(s) &amp; Date(s): #1, August 1970 - #8, October 1971 Double feature books. Issues feature work by Kirby, Wood and Barry Smith. Appearances by Black Panther, Kraven, Nixon &amp; Red Skull. This run represents the first Mavel Villain solo series. Front Cover: Strong gloss, bright color, clean white. No tears, creases or fading. Back Cover: Strong gloss, bright color, white. No tears, creases or fading. Corners: Sharp with minimal to no wear. Minor crease wear at lower right corner of issue #4. Wear at upper and lower left corners of issue #8. Edges: Sharp, clear definition. Spine &amp; Staples: Strong, straight and clean. A few crease lines near bottom staple of issue #4. Minor wear along spine edge of issue #8. Interior Pages: White. Strong, bright color. The books come bagged and boarded. Check out our other auctions for more great books! MORE QUESTIONS?

    <Description>This rare safety blade strop comes with the original box marked "Rhodes Kriss Kross Safety Blade Stropper. Price six dollars. Sold by Rhodes Mfg. Co., St. Louis". The box is in good shape. Still strong with no split corners. The strop itself is a remarkedly well designed machine. There is a sliding lock handle on the blade holder and a fold over cranking handle. The blade holder flips over as the handle is cranked to strop both sides of the blade. The body of the machine is marked on top and bottom similar to the printing on the box. Patent numbers are on the bottom dating from June 1921 to January 1927. Although used, it will clean up nicely.

    <Description>"We Three Kings" by Fitz and Floyd. Great, crisp, clean vintage 1976 Fitz and Floyd set of the three kings done in a white-on-white motif. If one wished to, I am sure small pillar candles could be placed in the crowns. My opinion? Just display them! The set features three different designs for face and crown. Each piece is 4 inches wide and 4.5 inches in height. All pieces are ink stamped "Fitz and Floyd Inc. MCMLXXVI" (1976). This was a great vintage find on several fronts _ finding the entire set and finding each piece in pristine condition without any sign of nicks, chips, cracks or flakes.

It is in good condition except for a tiny rip that is only in the white margin. This is only less than 1/4" long. I don't know any background on the old photos, I bougth them at an auction about five years ago. Please see my other glamour queen, pin up photographs I currently have listed on eBay.

    <Description>You're bidding on a VERY NICE run of ol' Greenskin. Included are issues: 111,112,116,123,124,126,127,128,129,130,131,133,134,136,137,140,141,142,143,145,146,148,149,151,152,153,155, and #200.. Plus Incredible Hulk Special #4. All are in BEAUTIFUL condition.. really nice comics. The only exception to this would be Issue # 200 which has some dark scuffing amidst the white background. Amazing the newest one is the worst.. and even it's prob at least a Fine grade comic. I believe issue 141 is the first appearance of Doc Samson.. saw it on here for about $50 all by itself and prob not as good as this one.. It looks about perfect to me. Issues 123,124,129,130, and 131 have store date stamps on the light part of the covers.. but nothing major.. other than that they appear to be NM. It would take me forever to look at each and every page of this many comics but the few I opened and checked only showed to be a little off-white around the edges.. and near the center. Nothing out of the ordinary for a 30 year old comic. Saw no creases or any other obvious blemishes.. other than those with the store dates. All are bagged and boarded.. and rather than risk damaging them in scans I chose to scan them in the covers so if you see a little "shimmer" .. it's the scan... not the comic. I really don't think you'll be dissapointed in any way with the condition of these comics. If so just tell me within 3 days and I'll refund your money.. minus shipping. I think that's a fair proposition. Trying to describe these as best I can so you'll know what you're getting before you bid. I haven't researched anything as to their true value.. I'll leave it to some savy bidders to do the research and bid accordingly. I'll start the bidding at $60 which I believe is a steal for this quality and quantity. I hate to set any limits at all but I feel 2 dollars a book is a pretty good buy.Sentimentally they're worth a lot more to me.. a part of my youth I held on to for all these years. You probably can't get that many brand new comics at that price. Much less true collector items. Anyways.. that's the deal. Hope you like what you see. Will accept PayPal, Money Orders, and Cashiers Check. Shipping will be a flat 7 dollars which will include: Well packed USPS Priority Shipping, Tracking # and insurance covering the total bid price. May cost more to do all this.. will be a fairly heavy package but I lean towards the buyer when it comes to shipping charges. I'm a buyer myself :) Thanks for looking and HAVE A VERY MERRY CHRISTMAS!!

Payment methods accepted: Personal Checks, Money Orders, Paypal, MasterCard, Visa and Discover. All shipping info below - please make sure you understand all the shipping/payment info before bidding or purchasing so that there are no misunderstandings. I want my customers to be happy :o) Shipping above is stated for US shipments only. For each additional item, shipping is $0.50. Canadian Shipping is $4.25, with each additional item shipping being $0.75. Other International Shipping is $6.00, with each additional item shipping being $1.00. Email if you have any additional questions. INSURANCE: Insurance is at the buyer's expense - and is optional. We charge flat USPS Insurance rates. If you are international, we HIGHLY stress paying the additional for shipping insurance since international shipments are more prone to being lost. I do not take any responsibility if items are lost or damaged in the mail if the customer does not choose to purchase the shipping insurance. I know the insurance is high - especialy for low-cost items. But the decision is totally up to the buyer. Slight Shipping Delay Shipping Status: 11/21/2001: Due to the fact we are in the midst of the holiday season - and I have taken on additional employment to supplement our family's income, please note - we are currently running 1-3 weeks on shipping. I will try to ensure that I ship your item as soon as I possibly can. I just wanted you to be aware of our shipping status in advance. But due to Christmas coming up, any payment received prior to December 16th, 2001 will ship by December 17, 2001 - to hopefully arrive before the holidays. But I cannot guarantee holiday delivery due to the post office not guaranteeing delivery. Thanks :o) ~Christy~ The fine print: If for some reason, the item that you have purchased is out of stock, we will send you an email immediately upon receiving your payment informing you of the estimated shipping date. We try to ensure our inventory numbers are correct before placing an item on Ebay, Yahoo, Amazon or Ubid, but due to the fact that we use several online shopping services and also sell via our own store and webstore, sometimes we sell an item that turns out to not be in stock. You could at that time decide to cancel the order and a full refund would be issued. Otherwise, the order will ship out on the estimated shipping date provided in email. We are a family business located in Missouri. We have been in business for 4 years. We strive to provide the most unique and high quality merchandise possible!!

This is a pretty neat collector's item for Hawaiiana or Tobacciana collections. Buyer pays s/h/i.

    <Description>This is an exceptionally cool crime anthology complete set with superb covers and interior art. Great covers by BRIAN BOLLAND, GLENN FABRY, &amp; TIMOTHY BRADSTREET. All of these are filled with several stories by such creators as JOE R. LANSDALE, DAVE GIBBONS, MARK CHIARELLO, DAVID LLOYD, RANDY DUBURKE, JAMES ROMBERGER, KILIAN PLUNKETT, TAYYAR OZKAN, TIM BRADSTREET, and many more. These are really very deep dark stories and of special not is a very cool RIHARD CORBEN art story that rivals the strong TIM BRADSTREET art story. There is a great gatefold cover on #1 featuring an assasin in a bathroom stall, and if you lift the cover (or open the bathroom stall door, their is the graphically slain body of his victim (both covers are scanned with the open gatefold being blurry due to not being able to flatten which is a good thing). This is truly a great complete series and well worth the reads. These range from very fine to near mint condition. All are very nic! e copies. Click here to view my other auctions!

    <Description>This is a copy of the Sept.'61 issue of MAD Magazine #65. It is in very good condition with a minimum of wear. There is some chipping and a small piece missing along the cover's edge, light spine creasing, and a grease-pencil mark on the cover near the base of the "M". The pages are slightly off color, but the edges and corners are crisp and undamaged. It is otherwise fine and in great shape overall. Add this one to your collection. Please email any questions at least one day prior to end of auction and be sure to check my other auctions for more issues of MAD and other really cool stuff.

    <Description>China has a long history of batik production dating back to the sixth century. Today you can still find batik being done by the ethnic people in Guizhou Province, in the South-West of China. Here the Miao, Bouyei and Gejia people use a dye resist method that is different from the Han Chinese. The Miao place great emphasis on their costumes which are made up of decorative fabrics which they achieve by pattern weaving and wax resist. Almost all the Miao decorate hemp and cotton (not silk) by applying hot wax then dipping the cloth in an indigo dye. The cloth is then used for skirts, panels on jackets, aprons and baby carriers. Indigo is used chiefly for the basic cloth throughout Guizo to give dark blues. A paste is made from the harvested plants which have been soaked in a wooden barrel. Wax resisted fabric was probably one of the earliest forms of decoration in Guizhou as all the materials were at hand. Beeswax is the main ingredient but other resins or wax are possibly added. The wax resist never exploits crackle, the aim is to produce a clear image and beeswax is both tenacious and flexible. The wax is often heated in a little pot, resting in hot embers. Once applied the wax appears black on the fabric but at the end of the process the wax is removed from the fabric. The fabric is then rinsed in cool water and air dried. The beeswax can be reused. The usual tools for applying wax are of copper and brass with bamboo handles. They are made from 2 small triangular pieces of metal, their apexes bound to a bamboo holder by copper wire. It is held like a pen either upright or at a slant to the cloth which is laid flat on a board. This tool lends itself to the drawing of straight or slightly curving lines. The Miao, Gejia and Bouyei girls are highly skilled at batik. They use very finely drawn circular and double spiral designs representing the horns of the water buffalo, symbolising their ancestor's life and death. Girls start learning to produce batik from the age of 6 and 7 years. The finest work is found on baby carriers, sleeves of their jackets and skirts. The more traditional designs are geometric, where the most skilled wax resist reads as a fine blue line on a white ground. With the influence of the Han Chinese more figurative designs like flowers, birds, fish have been introduced over the centuries. This item is Dragon &amp; Phoenix (3) batik.Size:45 inches long and 45 inches wide.International shipping postage is 9 US $.Combine shipping postage can be reduced.BATIK CAN ONLY BE SENT ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

    <Description>This is an opportunity to add 4 BEAUTIFUL, UNUSED acrylic Ice Blue Salad Bowls to your Tupperware collection! These 5.5 inch bowls have frosted and faceted bottoms. They are truly lovely, and are accompanied by their matching 11 inch round serving tray with handles. All items have never been used, but may have light scratches from storage. I'm unable to detect any on the bowls; the platter does have a couple of light scratches, but nothing to detract from its beauty. I want to be totally fair in my description, however. This set was expensive...the platter alone retailed for over $12.00, and the bowls retailed for over $16.00. Winner pays 6.45 Priority Shipping, and optional 1.10 for insurance; I pack very carefully but cannot accept responsibility for items damaged or lost by the postal service unless you insure. Payments by PayPal or Money Orders gladly accepted!</Description>

Great condition with cork stoppers intact and the roofs have 4 nails, which lead me to assume that they are nailed on. They measure 2 1/4" tall by 1 1/2" wide. Really Cute!

Please do not email me to request that I stop an auction to sell you an item privately. It is my firm policy that once I start an auction, I will let it follow through to completion (except in unusual cases such as breakage or erroneous listing). I do not think it fair to other potential bidders to put an item up and then pull it to make a quick sale. I try to offer my merchandise at the lowest possible price without a reserve, and therefore after the auction I do not cut prices on unsold items to bidders who make me an offer. I relist them and may or may not reduce the starting price. Created by eBay Seller's Assistant Pro</Description>

International buyers must pay by International Postal Money Order, Visa/MC through Paypal or US currency. International buyers please note: I will not falsify Customs documents, so please do not ask me to do so. Buyer to pay $8.00 S&amp;H in the continental US (AK and HI extra), less on multiple purchases. Insurance extra. Orders over $100.00 must be insured. WINNING BIDDERS: Please do NOT use the check out option (which sellers cannot get rid of). It is confusing and cumbersome. I will email you with payment details. Thanks. PA residents, please add 6% sales tax. For an explanation of my "CONDITION" terminology or an explanation of the "DUTCH AUCTION" process, CLICK HERE! Please click here to see my other auctions. Please do not email me to request that I stop an auction to sell you an item privately. It is my firm policy that once I start an auction, I will let it follow through to completion (except in unusual cases such as breakage or erroneous listing). I do not think it fair to other potential bidders to put an item up and then pull it to make a quick sale. I try to offer my merchandise at the lowest possible price without a reserve, and therefore after the auction I do not cut prices on unsold items to bidders who make me an offer. I relist them and may or may not reduce the starting price. Created by eBay Seller's Assistant Pro</Description>

    <Description>This is a high quality 1/4 hour chime bracket clock. This is a Lancet style or English Gothic Bracket clock. It is in excellent running order. The heavy movement has thick plates.

The silver dial has WHEATLEY above the center hole and CARLISLE under the center hole. The bezel has heavy beveled glass. The dial has a fast/slow adjustment at the top of the dial. This beautiful clock has string inlay edging the clock with accents in front and sides. The handles on the sides are especially pretty. The feet are typical bracket style feet. The pendulum is very heavy. It also comes with a old key. The markings on the movement(just in case my picture doesn't come thru) is W &amp; H and under that is SCH and under that is stamped 2. Please look at our pictures and email any questions. Our reserve is $550. for this excellent clock. Shipping in the U.S. is $40.00. Thanks for looking! God Bless America!</Description>

    <Description>In Elseworlds, heroes are taken from their usual settings and put into strange times and places - some that have existed or might have existed, and others that can't or couldn't or shouldn't exist.The result is stories that make characters who are as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow. It is a horror he cannot defeat.... ...a terrible thirst for blood that is forcing the Batman into acts of hideous corruption... Batman &amp; Dracula: Crimson Mist hardcover, the third book in a trilogy of Batman/Dracula tales. Brought to you by: Doug Moench, Kelly Jones, John Beatty, and Gregory Wright. Read once then put away. No longer in the shrinkwrap. Book and Dustjacket both in beautiful condition, near mint. Published by DC Comics.

    <Description>You are bidding on the set (JC, Lance, Justin, Joey, and Chris) of very hard to find NSYNC bobbleheads. All of the dolls have never been opened and are mint in box. I will priority ship (2-3 day) 4 out of the 5 dolls at auction end- as soon as payment is received, to ensure you will have these adorable dolls before Christmas. These are a must have for any NSYNC fan! I accept payment by cashier's check, money order, or PayPal (but due to changes in PayPals' policies I cannot accept credit cards). Shipping will be $7.00 + $2.00 insurance for the first 4 dolls, and $4.00 + $1.10 insurance for Chris. If you prefer to save on shipping costs, I can mail the whole set on December 26th for $8.00 + $2.00 insurance. Thanks for looking and HAPPY HOLIDAYS!! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>This original, complete booklet titled - PORTSMOUTH ELECTRIC RAILWAY, by O.R. Cummings and published in 1966. It is complete and in very good condition. It seems that a company named Electric Traction Quarterly published various editions relating to trolley cars. This is an edition concerning Portsmouth, New Hampshire and its surrounding area, e.g., Hampton Beach &amp;c. Replete with photographs and a detail and interesting history of this earlier form of prevalent transportation. It also includes a map illustration of their routes and well as illustrations of their schedules, tickets and revenue information. The scan(s) for this item may have been increased for better detail or reduced to facilitate faster viewing. Shipping is $1.75. Insurance is your option. Your item(s) are mailed 1st. Class (unless Priority Mail stipulated) _ Your personal check will not delay your shipment. For your convenience I use the PAYPAL INSTANT PURCHASE credit card payment method should you chose this mode of remittance. There is a link for this type of transaction on each auction page. This is another item from my lifetime collection of rare postcards as well as other important historical ephemera as well as old rare books. I am selling this collection, in its entirety, exclusively on eBay,. To be fair, I do not sell privately. Every item was personally acquired over several decades by inheritance, estate purchases, institutions, private negotiation from other collections and from museum de-accessioning. This entire collection is stored within a safe, smoke free, climate controlled, clean facility. Nothing offered is easily found. The name of this collection is _ RARE FARE. Since I am regularly listing items, I hope that you will bookmark my SELLER PAGES by my USER NAME rarefare.

    <Description>This is the oddest piece of Texas Ware/Melmac I have ever seen! It looks to be something that was sent out as an invitation to some kind of sales event/party for January 1978! This is the first of 2 that I found at estate sale in Cleveland Ohio, maybe this was left over from a salesmans career or???? Whatever it is from, the size is 7 1/2 inches wide. Condition excellent, colors bright and no scratching I can see anywhere. Odd smoking chicken floating over Lake Michigan and supposidly Chicago skyline. Please ask any questions via email ASAP. I will make every effort to reply as quickly as possible. Winning bidder to add $2.00 for careful, considerate packing and shipping via USPS mail. Insurance is extra if requested. PLEASE NOTE; I pick up mail and mail out packages on Monday, Wednesday and Friday ONLY. Money orders, cashiers and personal checks are accepted. PLEASE NOTE: personal checks will be held 7 working days to clear my bank I DO NOT ACCEPT BILLPOINT OR PAYPAL. PAYMENT DUE WITHIN 7 WORKING DAYS OF AUCTION END. USA DELIVERY ONLY.. At the end of the auction you will receive a confirmation email from me to which I need a reply to within 3 working days. When responding, please include the ebay #. Payment MUST be received within 7 working days, or the person will receive a notice from eBay. If payment isn_t made promptly, NEGATIVE feedback will be left and a credit obtained...which generates a warning from eBay. Sorry, but this is due to the increasing numbers of non-paying bidders. Serious bidders only please, PLEASE do not bid if you cannot agreee to above terms. Refund policy is simple-satisfaction guaranteed. If an item is not in stated condition or a flaw is honestly overlooked, please return the item and we will be happy to make a full refund minus shipping and ebay charges. Thanks so much for looking at my auction and please take a peek at the other neat things I have listed. REMEMBER: Always ready to combine items for shipping from multiple auctions. All I ask is that it is within a 10 day period and that you let me know if you win one item and intend to get another, because once an auction is finished I usually wrap up the item for quicker shipping.

    <Description>You are bidding on one quart milk bottle. One side is printed Royal Dairy, Inc.

The bottle and lid show signs of age, but are generally in good condition. The cardboard lid is spotted. Printed in the glass around the bottom is Sealed BB 48 One Quart Liquid 29MHX 925 REG. and on the bottom, printed in the glass is Duraglass (in script) 17 (a design in center) 47, and under that 29. I wonder if the 48 refers to 1948? The bottle was found in a shed that has been owned by the same person since about 1945. Buyer to pay actual shipping costs USPS priority mail, insurance optional.

    <Description>A sparkling copy with the purple color uniform throughout.Only some spine stress lines keep this from nm/m. This group of X men are mostly warehouse copies.Also note that this scan generally will overstate defects (Read what the buyer of a $1000.00 AF 15 recently said about our scan-nov 28 2001 feedback, or just to confirm read the Dec 3 2001 feedback of a VF Green Lantern purchase OR read what a buyer of a nm Thor said"Pinpoint grading (an ebay rarity!) Recommend this seller.Dec 3 2001)).All grades are guarenteed within 0.5 of any grading service. The grade quoted above is an accurate grade reflecting the true condition of the book.(Any defect not revealed by the large scan will be discussed apart).The price is set so that you will be hard pressed to find as good a deal anywhere else.(This 33% bigger scan( than the books' actual size) magnifies and enlarges defects-it is like looking at the book through a magnification factor). Generally speaking the book possess's a solid intact spine with no splits;staples solidly in place;corners sharp;gloss and color deapth vivid,deep and close to new in appearance;only minor spine stress marks may exist(similar to thoses produced at original printing);overall a glossy off white to WHITE paged copy offered at an unbeatable initial bid ,with a LOW RESERVE(This low reserve allows our customers to use the buy it now feature.Many have missed out on previous books,and this feature usually prolongs the auction a bit longer to give everyone a chance to bid).As we have a large multiple grade inventory of Silver and Golden age books,many will be offered for sale in coming ads.There are many comics being auctioned off on Ebay this week.Combine auctions to save postage.THOUSANDS of other books are still to come including most Marvel and DC titles from 1960 -1972.Use the BUY IT NOW feature to end the auction and lock out the competition. We are multiple CBG award winners;EBAY Power sellers;and have 1000 total positive feedbacks(many multiple) since we began here about 2 years ago.Some may remember us for our full page Marvel adds starting in the 1980's.Our Marvel inventory is extensive and stocked in multiple conditions..Note.All our scans are "High resolution".That means a magnified, extremley detailed scan which is about 33% LARGER than the actual size of the comic.( so, of course, defects appear about 1/3rd bigger,than if you were viewing the item right in front of you)..Why do we do this?Why do we want the comic to have all the defects OVERSTATED? Here are the reasons; 1)All defects are CLEARLY seen.(in our opinion a small scan is of no use-the grade can be anything). 2) By revealing all defects,you can grade based upon what you like or dislike about a book. 3) No two grades have the same defects,thus a large scan allows you to delineate the key aspects of the book. 4)A large scan will OVERSTATE defects.Defects appear LARGER than what you will see when you get the book.(This applies especially to creases(thicker than actual),and stress marks,and to a lesser extent to color tones,which may show gradations in color not visible with the naked eye).Most of our customers note that the book is nicer when it arrives than what this scan revealed(reasons;the scans bright flood light reveal evey single microscopic impact point,plus defects appear 33% larger.) 5)All our books are guaranteed to be in the same general grade range(within+/- 0.5) if the book is slabbed(within 14 days of purchase) 6) Full exchange privledges on any item purchased.within 7 days. 7) Shipping : Cost; 5.00 for less than 5 comics(priority mail with delivery confirmation) in North America NOTE ;Allow 2 weeks for material to reach you;we often beat that,but increased security screening by the post office can delay shipping time;we take full responsibility.... ..Questions and/or comments? Call 514 630 4518..We reserve the right to reject any bids we deem unacceptable,or not likely valid..Contact us BEFORE placing bid if you have a less than 10 rating... All winning bidders must respond and establish how they will pay within 24 hours of auction completion.

    <Description>Hi! Thanks very much for looking! just in time for christmas!! This is a beauty of a set! It is the: LENOX * HANCOCK GOLD * STAINLESS 5 PIECE PLACE SETTING!! BRAND NEW SET SKU #9862092!! RETAIL $120.00! This set is BRAND NEW! and each piece is individually wrapped and comes in the manufacturers packaging and box with all paperwork as if you had purchased it in the store. Included is a SALAD FORK, PLACE FORK, PLACE KNIFE, PLACE SPOON, and TEASPOON. The scan really is not that good as I just laid them on the scanner. You really cannot see the great detail in the gold accents, but trust me, its gorgeous. All pieces are new and flawless. Any lines, markes, dots, or imperfections seen are only from the scan and NOT the pieces. Please note that all the flatwear sets I offer on EBAY are NOT "factory seconds" nor are they "factory recalls". EVERY set I sell are ORIGINAL AND AUTHENTIC and are the EXACT SAME items (same sku, model# etc..)as you would get if you purchased these in the finest stores. Because of my very low starting prices on these sets, I have had several emails inquiring about the authenticity of these settings. TRUST ME, these are the REAL DEAL, and you can verify them by taking them to any retailer to have them looked at. I have sold well over 250 premium flatwear sets in the last several months on EBAY so you can view my feedback for further assurance. I do not mean to dwell too long on this, but I know that there are alot of "fake" stuff offered so I just wanted to put your minds at ease. Nowback to the auction. This set sells for a minimum of $120.00 at Hetch's! Sure you may find it less than that at some warehouse type outlets, but I guarantee you won't find it cheaper than here! This is a very beautiful design and made by one of the BEST manufacturers of flatwear sets. Minimum is only $19.99 which is ridiculous. Someone will be very happy with this set. You should always have extra settings for unexpected guests, and this is an excellent and affordable way to obtain one without spending mucho money! Please view my flawless 600+ feedback and know that I am an honest and reputable seller. A lot of flatwear on EBAY are advertised as "new condition" but in reality has been in the seller's possession for quite some time. All my items are BRAND NEW and AUTHENTIC!! I HAVE 4 TOTAL SETS OF THIS PATTERN UP NOW ON EBAY IN CASE YOU NEED MORE! I also have other premium sets curretly up on EBAY, so please check them out. This item will be sent via Priority Mail for $4.50. Additional settings won, please add $1 per setting for combined S/H. Insurance extra if desired, although I have never had a problem with lost or damaged mail by Priority Mail. But it's your choice. I accept PayPal, checks, and MOs. Thanks again and HAPPY BIDDING!!</Description>

    <Description>A beautiful piece from the 30's and one of many of the same style that I will be listing over the next few days. This is part of a large estate that I am liquidating. The mint condition 11 1/4" mat would look wonderful beneath glass either in a frame on on a table top. See scan of the item. (The smaller photos are of a section of another placemat and are used to show the intricacy of the embroidery) The scanner has cut off some of the item because of its shape (round) and size. This item will be shipped flat between 2 pieces of cardboard. Buyer pays $2.00 shipping...I will combine ship....Free shipping after $50 in mats is reached.</Description>

International bidders are welcome but need to be aware that international shipping charges may be CONSIDERABLY higher and will be determined after the auction ends.

    <Description>Antique Nickel-plated Tin Tennis Racket Chocolate Mold This is a wonderful figural chocolate mold in the form of a tennis racquet. We were lucky enough to find a small collection of these tin nickel-plated chocolate molds in an old house in Maine. This one has some light surface oxidation, overall in excellent condition. These molds tend to date from the late 1800s to the early 1900s and I believe this falls in that category. The mold measures 4.75 x 2.75 x .25 inches. We also have one other unusual chocolate mold on this week Buyer Pays $3.50 Shipping. Insurance additional if requested. VISIT OUR OTHER AUCTIONS AT KINGSBURYFARM</Description>

The tablecloth is approximately 31" by 34" and the napkins are 13" square. These linens have been used but are laundered and in excellent condition with no rips, tears or loose stitches although they have been folded and stored for a number of years so are wrinkled. Four of the napkins are lighter in color. We are not textile experts but believe this is 100% cotton. Christmas is coming, what person on your list would like to receive this as a present? We are also offering in separate a number of other vintage textiles so please take a look! We accept money orders, PayPal and Billpoint.

The glass shakers, cruet, and mustard jar are all of lovely crystal panelled glass with silverplated tops and rack. No markings that I could find. No chips or cracks to any of the glass. The two spoons that came with this set are both marked EPNS, and are plain, no pattern. Exact vintage of this set is unknown to me.

    <Description>_ Beautiful Collectable Budweiser Beer Stein _ This is a fantastic, quality beer stein. It came from a huge collection of Budweiser and Busch Beer Steins. The owner liquidated his colletion and I was fortunate enough to obtain these and offer them for bid. This stein is absolutely perfect in every way. Each side depicts the Clydesdale head and the front depicts the flying eagle in the A. The remarkably detailed beaded trim accents the Barley and Leaf pattern...it actually looks 3 dimensional when viewed at certain angles....Not your everyday run-of-the-mill cheap production beer stein for sure. It stands 6 7/8 inches tall and is hand painted cobalt blue, cream and brown...with accents of other colors. It bears the label Ceramarte on the bottom..Brazil Please see the other Budweiser Steins I have up for bid. See photos. Buyer pays 6.50 shipping. eserve is quite low for this quality beer stein....thank you.

    <Description>The newspaper advertisement shows the ad for christopher radko's appearance in walnut creek, Ca where I waited for hours to have Mr. Radko personally sign this ornament. I believe that now he no longer tours the country for these promotions as he did then. I can confirm that this is authentic, that I personally purchased this and that he signed it . There is also a card which will accompany the ornament which states that this is personally signed by christopher radko and also the small card which states that "this decoration is individually mouthblown, silvered, and handpainted, enhancing their collectability and making them a perfect holiday/hostess gift" This is a beautiful, signed ornament by christopher radko. Signed 1993. It measures 5 1/2" high, about 4" across the mid-section and 2" at the bottom of his feet. He is precious and reminds me of the pillsbury doughboy snowman with a red hat. This would be lovely on an all white decorated christmas tree. He is wearing a glittered scarf around his neck and has glitter cuffs at his ankles and wrists. This is like-new. . I will wrap well and double box this item. Buyer will please purchase insurance. Shipping will be $6.00 and insurance at cost. Billpoint, paypal and money orders only. Happy Holidays!!!!!
