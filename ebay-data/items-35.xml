    <Description>A beautiful new color for corsets! Jacquard weave emerald green satin with smooth black satin inserts flowing up the body from the thighs to the breasts and over the shoulders. Between the strap supports, the bones and the lacing up the back, your figure will look its best! Eleven spiral steel bones in the corset encourage good posture, adding inches to your height while the lacing subtracts inches from your waistline. The lacing is bi-directional. That means it laces from the bottom to the center and from the top to the center, putting the majority of the torque at the waist where you want it. Do your body and yourself a favor -- look sexy and feel great! Please read the sizing information below carefully. This wonderful corset is a size 36. The sizing refers to the approximate bust measurement. The waist will cinch tightly closed at 28" or open up to as much as 34". The satin panels do not stretch, so the waist is strictly confined between those two measurements. The bust measurement is a little more flexible, depending on how much bosom swell you want at the top. A 36D is going to look much more voluptuous than a 36B, for instance, but both could look sensational in this corset. Fourteen hook/eye sets fasten up the front. It measures 14" along the center front. There are loops for garters if you want to wear stockings with it. The picture shows matching panties; you are bidding on the corset. New, with manufacturer's tag. Click here to see our other auctions! Our eBay store, ProvocativeLingerie!

    <Description>This is an oversized clutch purse with a thin shoulder strap, (can be used or tucked in purse). What makes this an outstanding bag is that the over flap has cut out stars and moon crescents. The purse is made of navy leather, behind the cut-outs is gold leather. It measures, (when closed), 12 inches by 8 1/2 inches. It opens to 3 sections with a small zipped compartment. The inside is the gold-colored leather. The back of this purse has a slit pocket. There is a tag in the purse that states that this purse was a sample. Company name is 'albi'. I was told this purse is from the 1980's. Very good condition, there are some greenish spots on the inside gold lining, (probably from the factory). I don't think this purse was ever used. Really unique. Shipping within the United States will be $6.00.</Description>

    <Description>Here we have a brilliantly shiny and bright barrel link 'baht' style neck chain. This gorgeous chain is 24" long (beads and barrels are 6 mm wide) and weighs in about 30 grams of pure fine platinum with a pure platinum "W Lock" clasp. This is not filled or plated -- it is 100% solid pure fine platinum and is brand new! Pictures do not do this chain justice! It is a custom-designed unique chain. It is all Hand-Made custom jewlery. The chain is very strong. One of the many things that set this apart from any similar chain you might be able to find is that both ends of each hexagon 'barrel' link on this chain have been diamond cut -- this provides added shine and extra appeal. This (as all of my other jewelry for sale on ebay) is completely HAND-MADE -- giving the chain a more flexible and natural feel when you wear it. Most of the mass-produced neck chains have a stiff and rigid feeling when you wear them, mostly due to the links not being individually made(instead, they are cast in a mold -- this makes them much cheaper to make, but an inferior end product for you). Trust me, you will notice the "flowing" feel of this necklace the moment you put it on. This style necklace looks great by itself or with a pendant or charm -- you will definately get looks and compliments on this unique piece of custom jewelry. If you have any questions about this chain oe want additional pictures -- please feel free to contact me at LSIU99@aol.com Shipping on this item will be $15. I accpet Paypal, billpoint, money order.... For more hand-made jewelry, please view my other auctions for a gold and silver version of this style chain -- I also sell pendants, bracelets, and all other types of custom designed jewelry. I design and make most of my jewelry; therefore, you can hardly find the same jewelry in any other places:) Don't Miss it:) Thanks for viewing my auction! - Christine:)</Description>

    <Description>Here we have a brilliantly shiny and bright barrel link 'baht' style neck chain. This gorgeous chain is 18" long and weighs in about 12 grams of pure fine platinum with a pure platinum "W Lock" clasp. This is not filled or plated -- it is 100% solid pure fine platinum and is brand new! Pictures do not do this chain justice! It is a custom-designed unique chain. It is all Hand-Made custom jewlery. The chain is very strong. One of the many things that set this apart from any similar chain you might be able to find is that both ends of each hexagon 'barrel' link on this chain have been diamond cut -- this provides added shine and extra appeal. This (as all of my other jewelry for sale on ebay) is completely HAND-MADE -- giving the chain a more flexible and natural feel when you wear it. Most of the mass-produced neck chains have a stiff and rigid feeling when you wear them, mostly due to the links not being individually made(instead, they are cast in a mold -- this makes them much cheaper to make, but an inferior end product for you). Trust me, you will notice the "flowing" feel of this necklace the moment you put it on. This style necklace looks great by itself or with a pendant or charm -- you will definately get looks and compliments on this unique piece of custom jewelry. If you have any questions about this chain oe want additional pictures -- please feel free to contact me at LSIU99@aol.com Shipping on this item will be $15. I accpet Paypal, billpoint, money order.... For more hand-made jewelry, please view my other auctions for a gold and silver version of this style chain -- I also sell pendants, bracelets, and all other types of custom designed jewelry. I design and make most of my jewelry; therefore, you can hardly find the same jewelry in any other places:) Don't Miss it:) Thanks for viewing my auction! - Christine:)</Description>

    <Description>~GLAM WHITE ANGORA FUR COAT by Dino Ricco~M You are bidding on a fabulous white fur coat. The fur is angora rabbit, so it is long and silky-soft. The collar may be worn down, or up to keep you warmer and give a more dramatic look. Long sleeves. The front closes with strong hooks. The jacket is fully-lined in luxurious champagne-colored satin. I don't know very much about fur coats so I am probably leaving out some important details here - please email me with your questions. The seams and workmanship appear to be excellently done, and the jacket is very nice and warm! I can find nothing wrong at all with the jacket, except that there are a couple spots on the lining, right below the label. I think they will come out with cleaning. The tag says, "furrier method dry clean only". Here are the measurements, which I took on the inside because the fur is too fluffy to give an accurate measurement: length = 23", bust = 42", hem (which falls just above or on the hips depending on torso length) = 44". The sleeve from armpit to cuff is 17". Tag says size Medium. Beautiful, and a perfect gift! The close-up picture most accurately shows the color, the top 2 are too dark. Auction policy: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!! I accept payment only via paypal, bidpay, and money order. I will take personal checks but I do not ship your item until your check clears (can take as long as 14 days depending on your bank). Payment is due WITHIN 10 DAYS of the end of the auction. Shipping for this item is $7.25 within the U.S. (coat is heavy) For international bidders, I will ship your item via airmail, please let me know your location for a shipping price quote. Yes, I do combine shipping on all clothing. I reserve the right not to accept bids from those with a high ratio of negative feedback. If you do not agree with my payment or shipping policies, do not bid on my auctions. Deadbeat bidders will be reported to ebay safeharbor and receive negative feedback.

Do you know how weird it feels to checkout with 25+ different pairs of panties?! Just like the Tryst panties I had before which sold originally for around $8-$12.00 per pair in stores. These are great satiny soft feminine string bikinis with full backs. They have fabulous colors and fabric designs. This auction is for a Medium/6 with a waist size of 24" unstretched and 36" stretched. U.S. Shipping on this item is $1.95. If it is an additional purchase, the reduced shipping is $0.50.

    <Description>This is 1 of 2 I have up for auction, I also have the red one. This one is Stomper, the blue BIO bug. BIO Bugs are interactive, remote control, very large-about a foot long (not including the antennae) fighting insects! Ages 3 to about 11! To learn more and see much better pics, check the website-www.wowwee.com! They're very cool and can be played with alone, but will seek out other bugs on their own if you have more than 1! I will make sure it arrives in time for Christmas! Shipping will be $7.00 for 2 to 3 day delivery and insurance-NO HANDLING CHARGES! I have set the Buy it now for a little less than what I paid for the bugs, I paid $35, but most stores sell for $40. So if you include shipping, you're NOT paying some ridiculous price! PAYPAL or some other credit card/echeck method of payment is preferred, but will also accept check or money orders. Thanks</Description>

    <Description>Favorite Links _ Items for Llee1 _ _________ _ ORANGE WOOL PROP-TYPE FEDORA HAT 7 3/8 Even if you don_t have Jim Carry_s bank account numbers, you can still look the part (providing of course, you enjoyed "The Mask") with this outrageous bright orange fedora. This 100% wool attention grabber includes a HUGE 3 1/2-inch brim with matching edging, 5-inch crown, and 1 1/2-inch black band. There is one small stain on the front side of the under-brim, but it_s invisible with the hat on. I purchased this hat to accent my purple zoot-suit, but it_s just too small to accommodate my swelled head, so now_s your chance to be the center of attention. Please be clear that this is a fun hat, but it was certainly not manufactured by Stetson or Dobbs (feel free to bid like it was though). Please see all of my other great hat auctions!!! ***I have tried to describe all auctions in detail._ Please email me_ BEFORE bidding with specific questions, because once auction has closed I cannot offer refunds except under extreme circumstances._ I do not guarantee shipments without insurance and certification from USPS._ If you want it--ask._ Please see my pos feedback and you'll see that I"m a quality seller!_ Happy Bidding!!!*** Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

Clinical Study Clinical Study : Longevity 4 (L-4) Conducted by Dr. Essman, Endocrinologist Date started on treatment: August 1, 1999 Date finished treatment: October 1, 1999 After 30 years of aging, levels of human growth hormone substantially decrease. Low levels of human growth hormone are directly associated with the many diseases associated with the aging process. Raised levels of HGH have produced health improvements and benefits. Dietary supplements composed of amino acids have been shown to promote the secretion of human growth hormone release. Pepsin has been shown to increase the amplitude and frequency of high release, in addition to amino acids. Argintine has been shown to diminish the effects of somatistatin, which is produced by the pituitary gland and inhibits human growth hormone from being distributed. Human growth hormone immediately changes into IGF-1 as we sleep. Increased IGF-1 levels indicate that human growth hormone have raised correspondingly. http://www.speerindustries.com/images/spray.jpg of HGH have produced health improvements and benefits.

    <Description>This is an hand-carved brooch of prehistoric Siberian Woolly Mammoth ivory. The ivory is 15,000 years old! It comes with a certificate of authenticity from the Paleontological Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences (so it will not be confused with elephant ivory). It is approximately 1-1/2 inches by 2 inches. I used the same picture (lazy) for two matching pins so there is a nearly imperceptible difference. I take Paypal &amp; personal checks.</Description>

HERE'S HOW IT WORKS: Your Maximum Bid Is Kept Secret, And It's Not Necessarily What You'll Pay. eBay Will Bid On Your Behalf (Which Is Called Proxy Bidding) By Steadily Increasing Your Bid By Small Increments Until Your Maximum Is Reached. Why bid by Proxy? Because It Means You Don't Have To Monitor The Auction As It Unfolds. You Also Don't Have To Worry About Being Outbid At The Very Last Minute Unless Someone Bids Over Your Maximum Dollar Amount. Want More Details? Check Out AN EXAMPLE OF PROXY BIDDING _ Choose Your Maximum Carefully, Though, As You Won't Be Able To Reduce It Later. Reserve Price Auction The reserve price is the lowest price a seller is willing to sell an item for. This amount is generally higher than the minimum bid. In order to win the auction, a bidder must meet or exceed the reserve price and have the highest bid. If no bidders meet the reserve price, neither the seller nor the high bidder are under any further obligation to complete the transaction.

    <Description>This is a black leather purse made by Enzo Angiolini. It has two (2) compartments inside with one small zippered compartment on one side. There are two (2) side pockets, one on each outer side of purse. Great for that cell phone so you don't have to dig when it rings. The purse measures 8" x 10". There is a little flap for closure on the top about 1 1/2" wide. There is one little place on one of the staps that looks like a little cut. I have included a picture for you to see how little it affects the purse. Please e-mail with any questions. High bidder to pay shipping and handling. I do not accept paypal at this time.

    <Description>BIG BROTHER ~ The Game ~ By Pressman WHO GETS KICKED OUT? WHO GETS TO STAY? Just like the TV show players get to know each other AND you get to know yourself. Good qualities are rewarded; personality flaws are definitely not! Who wouldn_t think of sneaking a peek at someone else_s diary? Who loves to talk about everyone_s else_s mistakes? Who can step in at a moment_s notice and take care of a problem? Who_s the biggest cheapskate at the table? Try to get the most votes for the good qualities _ hope that you don_t get them when the nasty stuff comes up. You_ll never play the same Big Brother game twice! Hundreds of different _confrontations_ make it a different experience every time! And camera cards may catch any player doing something best not done in public! 5 SIGNS THAT YOU_RE READY TO PLAY: You can handle it when your friends tell you what they think. You certainly don_t mind telling your friends what you think. You can take the bad news with the good. You can give the bad news with the good. ~ AND ~ You can remember_..it_s a game! For 4 to 6 Adult Players ages 16 and up. Game manufactured in 2000 by Pressman Toy Corporation This game is BRAND NEW &amp; FACTORY SEALED. High Bidder pays $6.85 shipping and handling (IT'S HEAVY!!) delivered anywhere in the 48 states. All items are shipped in a secure box with delivery confirmation. Insurance is available on request and strongly encouraged. I wrap every auction very carefully but I cannot be responsible for items that are lost or damaged in the mail. Terms: I accept MasterCard and Visa through PayPal. Money orders are preferred over checks but checks will be accepted-- but please understand that shipment of your auction could be delayed until the check has cleared. I request that payment be made within 10 days of the conclusion of this auction. If that is not possible, email me as soon as possible to prevent your item from being relisted. All of my items come from a nonsmoking home. Manufacturer_s warranty only.</Description>

    <Description>This auction is for 4 brand new, never removed from the box or displayed, Jay Leno Hot Wheels Legends 4 car set. These are VERY HARD TO FIND CARS!! What great cars to add to your collection. In recognition of Leno's love of cars, Mattel has created the Hot Wheels Legends Jay Leno Collection. The four die-cast cars selected for the series all represent vehicles that set a standard for cutting edge technology and eye-catching design, which is why they appealed to Leno in the first place. Cars featured in this auction are: Lamborghini Miura ~ This car was the original mid-engine Italian exotic car that combined trend-setting styling with high-performance technology and helped establish the reputation of Lamborghini, Jaguar XKE ~ Leno usually doesn't customize cars, but his Jaguar is an exception. The front end is from a 1972 XKE, while the rear portion is from a 1963 XKE. Shelby-Cobra Replica ~ Leno has always coveted the legendary 427 Shelby Cobra, but knowing that tracking down just the right example of this limited production car can be nearly impossible, he created his own version of this classic. Leno's version of this classic differs slightly from the stock version-it's powered by a 427 single overhead cam, which was used successfully in powerboat racing. Shelby Mustang GT350 ~ Leno has always been a big fan of Ford cars, so when a Ford-powered Cobra beat Ferrari at Le Mans, it was like a Super Bowl victory for Leno. This Shelby Mustang features the same engine. Are you starting your Christmas shopping early? These would make great gifts!! Winning bidder to pay $3.95 shipping (insurance optional). I accept money orders and visa/mastercard through Paypal. NO PERSONAL CHECKS AND NO INTERNATIONAL OR CANADA BIDDERS, PLEASE. Email me if you have any questions.I accept money orders and visa/mastercard through Paypal. NO PERSONAL CHECKS AND NO INTERNATIONAL OR CANADA BIDDERS, PLEASE.

    <Description>This auction is for two outfits. Please note the following information. The first outfit is New Without the tags. I thought I would wear this on our September baby one day and then changed my mind thinking it wasn't worth wearing a new outfit and being cold all day. So, she never did get to wear it. It is a two piece set by Tiny Tots. Very soft. It has green, purple and white stripes. On the chest (on a white background) is a heart embroidered with the word, "Love" in the center. There are two bows on either side of the tummy. It has shorts that match. The second outfit is by Little Miracles. The bad news first...the top snap at the back of the neck is broken. All of the pieces are there, but the snap has come apart (if you've ever dealt with baby clothes, you know just what I'm talking about). If you're ingenius, I'm not, you would be able to fix it. The other way to get around is to not use the top snap. Anyway it's a very soft white two piece outfit with a little sleeveless top and matching romper pants. There are blue and pink flowers embroidered on the chest and a little satin bow attached. Really a sweet outfit. Too bad about the snap. Both outfits are size 3 - 6 months. Buyer to pay fixed shipping of $3.00. I will combine shipping for multiple wins. I accept Pay Pal, money order and personal check. Thanks for your interest. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>New with Tags Donna Loren Control Brief Size: Medium Color: Red as shown in the photos This is a beautiful control brief in a gorgeous red with beaded details on the front panel. When was the last time you saw a control brief in a color other than black, beige or white? This item has all tags attached. This control brief originally retailed for $24.99 (see close-up of the tag below). It is brand new and has never been worn. This item really does what it is supposed to do. I tried the brief on under a skirt and the difference in the fit and look was incredible. One nice thing about this control brief is that it doesn't flatten out your behind like some other control briefs tend to do.

    <Description>8 OZ ROSEWATER &amp; GLYCERIN LOTION + ROSE SOAP - Remember the sweet-smelling rosewater and glycerin hand lotion your grandmother used? Well, it is just as fragrant today as it was a century ago. Problem is, it can cost 25 to 40 dollars for a small tube or jar. So when I finally found a supplier with a reasonable price tag, I stocked up to get the biggest discount possible. Now I can share the savings. The starting bid is just $8.00 for 8 ounces (not four). And I will include TWO bars of soap made with genuine rose essence as a little bonus. My auction list also contains a rosewater and glycerine spray for the skin, hair and linens. Win both and save on shipping. These items are new and unused and make a great gift for the "lady who has everything"... There's nothing like the scent of roses. Product Description: Glycerine &amp; Rosewater lotion for hand and body, oil-free, soothing and mositurizing, not tested on animals. Bee &amp; Flower Rose Soap, 2.65 oz. Size (75 gm) made by Superior Ginseng, good lather, wonderful lasting fragrance, a must-have for rose lovers. Made with natural rose essence and beautifully packaged. Imported from China. SHIPPING: Please take a moment to read my shipping information paragraph BEFORE you bid (and my auction list above after you bid). If you want me to consider an exception to any of these policies, you must email me before placing a bid so that we can discuss it. Thanks! SHIPPING AND PAYMENT: Buyer pays shipping. US or Canada only. In the USA or Canada, winner pays $3.95 shipping. USA insurance is an additional $1.10 and registration to Canada (insurance for up to $499.00) is an extra $7.50. Buyer assumes risk if registration is not purchased. Specify insurance with payment or your package might not be insured. Multiple wins on my auction list mean shipping cost savings! Prefer money order, cashier_s check or personal check (must wait for it to clear), but will also accept Pay-Pal and Billpoint (eBay payments). Oklahoma residents MUST add 8.5% sales tax. I cannot accept bids from buyers with LESS than zero feedback (net negative points). ALL auction sales final but I work very hard to make sure my customers are satisfied and will correct any mistake I make.</Description>
