    <Description>Movies! Movies! Movies!!! 20 postards from movies all shown in the scan! Some extras too I haven't had time to scan! Makes a great stocking stuffer! Winner pays $3.50 PRIORITY MAIL shipping in US. Must receive payment within 10 days of auction ending. Checks and money orders please - PayPal has gotten too expensive! You_ll notice the shipping rate listed is for US Residents. That would be because I state whereever possible in my auctions that I only accept bids from US bidders. Overseas mail takes way too long and way too many email exchanges. So if I get an email from a winner and it says something like "I_m so excited! Thanks for your address! I_ll send $3.50- here_s my address! and then lists some country in Europe or Asia ..." That would mean you don_t live in the US - thus you shouldn_t be bidding on this! Sorry bout this but blame the Canadians and Australians who have ruined it for others!

Meet Elliot Richards, a well-meaning but socially inept technical-support advisor who is in love with Alison Gardner, a female co-worker. Unfortunately she barely knows he's alive. Desperate to gain Alison's affections, Elliot strikes a deal with the Devil - a lusty, drop-dead gorgeous woman with, as he'll soon discover, a wicked sense of humor. In exchange for Elliot's soul, the temptress will grant him seven wishes. To start, Elliot asks to be rich, powerful and married to Alison. When he awakens the next morning, he discovers he's all that and more - as a Colombian drug lord. No problem, he thinks, because he's got six more wishes. How about becoming the most emotionally sensitive man in the world? Sure, only Elliot ends up a sniveling, driveling fool. A 7' 6" basketball superstar? Elliot breaks all NBA records, but unfortunately his "equipment" doesn't measure up. Elliot is learning the hard way to be careful what he wishes for. Because the Devil, always a step ahead of him, is dishing up hilariously subversive versions of Elliot's desires, turning each of his new lives into a living hell. BEDAZZLED stars BRENDAN FRASER as Elliot Richards, a hapless young man consumed by unrequited love and desperate to change his life. ELIZABETH HURLEY plays the Devil, who slyly promises to do just that - for a price. FRANCES O'CONNOR plays Alison Gardner, the object of Elliot's affections. 6660024 This outfit is worn by Brendan as the drug lord when he desires to be "rich". Click here to view all FOX Auctions.

    <Description>SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE - VHS-MALKOVICH &amp; DAFOE SHADOW OF THE VAMPIRE - VHS - Previously Viewed John Malkovich and Academy Award nominee Willem Dafoe star in a riveting suspense thriller about an obsessive director who's so consumed with making the most realistic vampire movie ever, he's willing to sacrifice everything - and everyone - to achieve his vision! In his quest to create a vampire film to die for, F.W. Murnau (Malkovich) hires the mysterious Max Schreck (Dafoe) to play Count Orlock in his masterpiece Nosferatu. Murnau introduces Schreck as "the ultimate method actor" -- one who will appear only in character, in full makeup and only at night. But as the cast and crew begin to disappear, it appears that Murnau has made a devil's bargain with Screck. With luminous performances and biting humor, Shadow of the Vampire holds you in its icy grip from start to finish. Rated R. Approximate running time: 93 minutes. This is a previous rental and in excellent condition and in the original release box. TAKE A LOOK AT ALL VIDEO EXCHANGE AUCTIONS BY CLICKING HERE !! U.S.P.S.

Walsh Director: F. Gary Gray Categories: Thriller Rated: R (Violence, Profanity ) Running Time: 138 minutes DVD Features: Negotiator AUCTION INFO: For Sale in this auction is a Previously Viewed DVD Copy of "The Negotiator" All of our movie auctions start at $1 NO RESERVE.

Don't forget to view our other auctions for ton's of great movies. SYNOPSIS: F. Gary Gray directed this suspenseful action thriller based on a real case experienced by police in St. Louis. The James DeMonaco/Kevin Fox screenplay follows an accused man who is forced to commit crimes in order to prove himself innocent of murder. After Chicago police hostage negotiator Danny Roman (Samuel L. Jackson ) succeeds in rescuing a little girl menaced by her gun-wielding dad, he's praised by both the police department and the media, and he returns to his usual cop routines with his longtime partner, promising his new wife Karen (Regina Taylor ) he'll make it home for dinner every night. Then his partner, who had evidence of embezzlement within the police department, is killed. Since Danny arrives at the crime scene only seconds later, he's the main suspect, and Chief Al Travis (John Spencer ) asks him to turn in his gun and badge. Danny invades the Chicago Internal Affairs Division headquarters and tries to get the truth from Inspector Terence Niebaum (J.T. Walsh) while holding two assistants and Commander Frost (Ron Rifkin) as hostages. He then calls for an outsider from another precinct, hostage negotiator Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey ). When Sabian arrives, the two compete for control, while Danny attempts to prove to him that he's been falsely accused. The film is dedicated to J.T. Walsh, who died not long after the production wrapped. ~ Bhob Stewart, All Movie Guide I love Harry Potter Matrix Star Trek cell hobbit lord of the rings star wars</Description>

    <Description>Untitled Document _ Title Paperback Hero NEW FACTORY SEALED Description Paperback Hero is the thoroughly charming new Australian film-starring heartthrob Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Oklahoma). Jack Willis, truck driver, who has just become a top selling romantic novelist. To avoid embarrassment (being a man's man!) he needs a name, a woman's name, and he chooses that of his best friend, Ruby Vale. When publisher Ziggy Keane arrives to sign 'Ruby Vale' to a major book deal, Jack has to convince his friend to keep up the charade. Like two fish out of water and out of their depths, Jack and Ruby are drawn closer together as they cope with all the media attention and the big city life. A charmingly romantic comedy of errors and triangles emerge. TOTAL FILM said that 'Paperback Hero' is "the best thing to come out of Australia since MURIEL'S WEDDING". THE SUN said that the film has "ripe characters, great performances, and breathtaking locations Starring: Hugh Jackman, Claudia Karavan and Angie Milliken.

This comprehensive video collection is an everlasting monument to one of the funniest and most enduring TV shows of all time. The immortal Jackie Gleason stars in The Honeymooners, with beloved sidekicks Art Carney, Audrey Meadows, and Joyce Randolph. This is a Brand New Box Set still Factory Sealed!

However, once Deane enters the bizarre world of Stargher's mind, she finds getting out to be a very difficult matter. The Cell was the first feature from director Tarsem, who previously made award-winning commercials and music videos, including the video for R.E.M.'s "Losing My Religion." The supporting cast includes Catherine Sutherland, Marianne Jean-Baptiste, Dylan Baker, and Pruitt Taylor Vance. ~ Mark Deming, All Movie Guide I love Harry Potter Matrix Star Trek cell hobbit lord of the rings star wars</Description>

    <Description>JEZEBEL. Stars: Bette Davis, Donald Crisp, Fay Bainter, George Brent, Georgia Caine, Gordon Oliver, Henry Fonda, Henry O'Neill, Irving Pichel, Jack Norton, Janet Shaw, John Litel, Margaret Lindsay, Richard Cromwell, Spring Byington. Set in the antebellum South, William Wyler_s JEZEBEL centers on high society beauty Julie Marsden. Julie first arrives on horseback, then enters her home flamboyantly hooking the long flowing train of her dress with her riding crop and hoisting it to her shoulders. Julie is not just high-spirited--she is self-centered and high-handed, and she gets away with outrageous behavior because she is rich and beautiful. However, she gets her comeuppance--losing Pres and becoming reclusive and spiteful--before a chance for redemption occurs. JEZEBEL is built around Bette Davis_s bold, powerful, and, at times, subtle performance; when Julie discovers Pres and Amy are married, with the smallest of movements Davis conveys disbelief, then anguish as she realizes the truth--she looks down, her eyelids flicker, she glances from Pres to Amy and back, and utters single words while struggling to maintain her composure. And Fay Bainter, as Aunt Belle, matches Davis when she too discovers Pres is married and continues to greet her guests while worrying about her niece and how she can warn her. Both actresses won well-deserved Oscars. JEZEBEL is also distinguished by Wyler_s and cinematographer Ernest Haller_s graceful, flowing long takes and deep-frame compositions. VHS AND Cover are in Excellent Condition (cover has light wear). $3.50 U.S. Shipping $4.00 Canada $4.95 Europe / Japan. Pay With Paypal Cash Check Money Order. Paypal Mattemedium @ AOL.COM.

    <Description>BOB HOPE, celebrity collectable COIN, L@@K This is a Mardi Gras doubloon that pays tribute to the famous Bob Hope. Every year the Krewe of Bacchus has a celebrity guest. The coins are always the color of wine as Bacchus is the God of Wine I believe. They don't scan well but are very nice when you see them. I have a number of different celebrities on these coins. You may want to try to collect all of them. Only .75 cents to ship in the U.S. I have a number of related items up for sale on eBay. If you would like to see them click here. Bob Hope (Leslie Townes Hope) actor, comedian Born: 5/29/03 Birthplace: Eltham, England American film, radio and television comedian known for his topical jokes, quick delivery and long career in show business. He appeared in several Road films with comedy partner Bing Crosby and Dorothy Lamour. His films include Road to Utopia (1940) and The Paleface (1947). Since 1940, Hope has tirelessly entertained U.S. troops stationed overseas. For those of you who don t know, Mardi Gras doubloons are brightly colored aluminum coins about the size of a silver dollar. They are thrown by Krewe members from Mardi Gras floats. Doubloons usually have the symbol of the Krewe on the front along with the date the Krewe was organized, the back side usually has the theme for that years parade as well as the date. Each Krewe may have a number of different doubloons for each years parade. Usually the silver ones are the most common, followed by a range of colors from red to gold. Some Krewes mint real bronze, silver and even gold doubloons, however these are very rare and seldom put up for sale. Many Mardi Gras doubloons are fairly rare outside of New Orleans, and many are rare even in the city. They make great inexpensive yet unique collectibles or gifts. I am in the process of auctioning a number of doubloons from my collection. The subject matter of my individual doubloon auctions vary a great deal. I have coins for a lot of different themes. If you would like to see my other coins please CLICK HERE.. Shipping is only $.75 cents in the United States. Buy a number of coins and save on shipping. Thank you for looking at my auction, and have a nice day. NO RESERVE! Shipping for one doubloon is .75 cents. I do combine shipping on auctions to save you money, so bid on as many auctions as you like, and I will save you money on shipping. Please click here to see the other auctions I have posted on eBay. I have hundreds of different coins with a wide variety of themes available. This listing created by eBay Seller's Assistant Basic.</Description>

    <Description>This is a 2 VHS set of A&amp;E's "California and the Dream Seekers" (1997). It is America's promised land where eccentric visionaries become millionaires overnight, and the promise of gold, oil, and stardom have lured millions for a shot at their dreams. California's epic history comes alive in this vibrant production from the Emmy_-winning creative team behind A&amp;E's acclaimed FLOATING PALACES. Head west in the largest mass-migration since the Crusades as Americans are swept up in Gold Fever. See rare clips of the birth of Hollywood and travel to France with Count Harszthy who brought back the cuttings that started Napa's world-famous wineries. Experience the horror of the San Francisco Earthquake, and discover how World War II changed California as much as the Gold Rush! From the Jesuit missionaries who first carved out a place in its vast wilderness to the high-tech wonderland of Silicon Valley, this is the ultimate look at CALIFORNIA AND THE DREAM SEEKERS! This 2 VHS set is released by A&amp;E Home Video, is in color, and has a total running time of 200 minutes. The videos and sleeve are in excellent, mint condition (not a rental.) Shipping is $3.95 for priority mail ($1.75 for bookrate is also available) and will be added to the winning bid. I gladly accept Paypal and Billpoint payments - in addition to checks and money orders.</Description>

Copyright Date: 1992 Box Condition: Original box in excellent condition. Playing condition: Previously viewed. Plays well and sounds good. Running Time: 93 minutes. Rating: R This is what the box says about this film: It began on a quiet Sunday in Gatlin, Nebraska. That was the day the children slaughtered all the grownups. Isaac, the boy preacher, told them that He Who Walks Behind the Rows was pleased, and three years later the children still follow Isaac and his evil teenage disciple, Malachai. When a young couple traveling cross-country accidentally drive into Gatlin, they begin to discover the town's terrible secrets. However, what they don't realize is that they have become part of the children's bloody mission; a mission that cannot be fulfilled until the two intruders are dead.

    <Description>David Bowie - Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence DVD Country : Japan / New Zealand / UK Director : Nagisa Oshima Starring : David Bowie, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Tom Conti Winner of BAFTA Film Award - Best Score (Ryuichi Sakamoto) of 1984 British Academy Awards , Best Actor (Tom Conti) of 1983 National Board of Review, USA This is Not a Film about War, this is a Film about Cultures Lose yourself in this film. This is a film full of atmosphere - wonderful cinematography, beautiful locations, a stunning soundtrack and some fantastic performances. Don't look at this film and think this is a war film, it isn't, this is film about East meets West, Clashes of tradition, culture and beliefs. However the best thing about this film is that the more you watch it the better it gets. If such a thing as mood music exists then this is mood film - switch the lights off, turn the sound up and be absorbed. Visually stunning, fantastic soundtrack, outstanding performances all around. In 1942 British soldier Jack Celliers comes to a japanese prison camp. The camp is run by Yonoi, who has a firm belief in discipline, honour and glory. In his view, the allied prisoners are cowards when they chose to surrender instead of commiting suicide. One of the prisoners, interpreter John Lawrence, tries to explain the japanese way of thinking, but is considered a traitor. This is an original official released DVD. This imported DVD is region free all-coded and thus playable on any DVD players.

Any item(s) not paid for within 15 days of auction end will be re-listed and appropriate feedback posted. If there is a problem preventing you from completing your transaction, let me know and I will work with you. If you don't communicate, I can't work with you. Please-no bids from people with excessive negative feedback or excessive (more then two) bid retractions. Just for the record, I ONLY sell original items, NO _home made_ copies - EVER! For US bidders, all items that qualify for Media Mail Shipping, will be sent at the Media Mail (formerly Book Rate Mail) Rate (7-14 days per the USPS web site), with Delivery Confirmation. For example MOST (but not all) video games, single CD's &amp; single videotapes cost $1.83. ALL Items that do not qualify for Book Rate will be sent Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. For all items shipped at the Media Mail Rate OR Priority -- DELIVERY CONFIRMATION IS MANDATORY -- NO EXCEPTIONS!!! _ _ If you desire insurance coverage (mandatory on items with a $25.00 or higher final value), please inquire. Insurance is MANDATORY on ALL items shipped First Class -- NO EXCEPTIONS!!! _ Items not covered by either Delivery Confirmation (or insurance) WILL NOT BE SHIPPED until the proper fee is paid. If you are the high bidder on multiple items, they will be packaged together whenever possible, to save on shipping.

Don't forget, I still and always have accepted personal and business checks, and money orders payable in U.S. currency. Please DO NOT e-mail me when the auction ends.

As far as overseas deliveries, unless you elect to take insurance (if available in your country) or some sort of Delivery Confirmation-type service (if available in your country), I cannot assume any responsibility for items sent outside of the US of A. Needless to say, all payments from countries outside the US must be made payable in US dollars. IF you have a non-U.S. checking account, that is payable in U.S. dollars, it MUST be payable through a U.S. bank. It is up to you to find out if your country's postal service has any sort of insurance or Delivery Confirmation-type service BEFORE you bid. By placing a bid on this item, you are agreeing to the above terms. I guarantee the playability/workability of all items that I sell, 100% or a full refund.

    <Description>Lasse Hallstrom's Chocolat (2000) WIDESCREEN DVD!! MINT!!! 5 Oscar Nominations!! Stars Johnny Depp, Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina and Lena Olin. Edition Details: _ Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only) _ Color, Closed-captioned, Widescreen, Dolby _ Commentary by director Lasse Hallstrom and the producers _ Production Design Featurette _ Making Of Chocolat _ Deleted Scenes _ A feature on the film's costumes _ Widescreen anamorphic format With movies like Chocolat, it's always best to relax and absorb the abundant sensual pleasures, be it the heart-stopping smile of chocolatier Juliette Binoche as she greets a new customer, an intoxicating cup of spiced hot cocoa, or the soothing guitar of an Irish gypsy played by Johnny Depp. Adapted by Robert Nelson Jacobs from Joanne Harris's popular novel and lovingly directed by Lasse Hallstr_m, the film covers familiar territory and deals in broad metaphors that even a child could comprehend, so it's no surprise that some critics panned it with killjoy fervor. Their objections miss the point. Familiarity can be comforting and so can easy metaphors when placed in a fable that's as warmly inviting as this one. Driven by fate, Vianne (Binoche) drifts into a tranquil French village with her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol, from Ponette) in the winter of 1959. Her newly opened chocolatier is a source of attraction and fear, since Vianne's ability to revive the villagers' passions threatens to disrupt their repressive traditions. The pious mayor (Alfred Molina) sees Vianne as the enemy, and his war against her peaks with the arrival of "river rats" led by Roux (Depp), whose attraction to Vianne is immediate and reciprocal. Splendid subplots involve a battered wife (Lena Olin), a village elder (Judi Dench), and her estranged daughter (Carrie-Anne Moss), and while the film's broader strokes may be regrettable (if not for Molina's rich performance, the mayor would be a caricature), its subtleties are often sublime. Chocolat reminds you of life's simple pleasures and invites you to enjoy them.

    <Description>MEN IN BLACK MR. SMITH &amp; MR. JONES DVD NEW Description In the 1950s a super-secret government agency was formed to monitor and police the activities of extraterrestrial aliens on the planet Earth. Some 40 years later a founding father of the agency, Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), finds himself with a new smart-mouthed partner fresh from the NYPD who is soon dubbed Agent Jay (Will Smith). Their first mission is to save the Earth from destruction by a giant insectlike alien (Vincent D_Onfrio) that, incidentally, drives an exterminator_s truck. Armed with their matching Ray-Bans, skinny ties, and space-age weapons that Jay barely understands--he calls the Neuralyzer the "flashy thing"--the new duo begin another average day of fighting intergalactic terrorists. An amazingly hip and terribly clever movie that riffs on everything from E.T.--THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL to CASABLANCA, this Barry Sonnenfeld film is based on the equally savvy comic book by Lowell Cunningham.

    <Description>HIGHER LEARNING LD Widescreen Ice Cube Description 2 Discs, Used, WODESCREEN http://us.imdb.com/Title?0113305 John Singleton is such a good director that his bad movies have all been interesting--enough so that they have not tanked at the boxoffice--and such is the case with his latest opus, Higher Learning , released as a Deluxe Widescreen Presentation by Columbia TriStar Home Video (73396, $40). About racial tension at a California college, the characters are hopelessly stereotyped and grouped according to race, with the black guys being cool, the white guys being racists and rapists or, at the very least, slobs, and the women being prizes to be earned, even if the heroes win the sensitive, smart ones. Singleton made a name for himself coming out of college with a film script that landed him his first director's job, but it is hard to believe, watching the film, that he ever visited a campus. He turns the stimulating diversity of a university student body into a clich_d Balkanization of race and depicts professors ejecting students from classes for not paying their tuition on time. Many scenes in the 126 minute movie also go on for too long, and there is one very young actor playing a white racist who seems to be trying to imitate Marlon Brando in Roots II . That said, however, the film has a number of strikingly designed sequences, and in its exploration of racial and economic polarities it takes the time to present intelligent arguments--honest-to-goodness messages--about the necessity of working to the best of one's capabilities and not giving up in the face of despair. There is one especially memorable romantic sequence, an intercutting of two scenes, where one of the heroines is seen embracing a male lover in some shots and a female lover in others, edited in such a way that the gender of the woman's partner becomes irrelevant to the eroticism. Laurence Fishburne is also on hand as a political science teacher, and he handles what could be a very embarrassing role with great finesse, delivering Singleton's morals without batting an eyelash. Singleton depicts college as a place where the abstract intellectualism of learning grinds against life's realities, searching for an even sprocket. He manages to find a few, not enough to prevent the movie from failing, but enough to make the failure worthwhile. The picture is letterboxed with an aspect ratio of about 1.85:1 and the framing looks accurate. The color transfer is fine. Fleshtones are a little soft at times, but the image is solid and darker scenes are stable. The stereo surround sound is good, and the music soundtrack is appropriately boisterous. The program is effectively closed captioned. The film is spread to three sides in CLV and is accompanied by a promising theatrical trailer A film by John Singleton.

Gorgeous 8 X 10 color glossy photo of actress BARBARA EDEN. An Arizona native, actress Barbara Eden was three years old when her family moved to San Francisco, where as a teenager she plunged into acting and singing classes at San Francisco State College's Conservatory of Music. After briefly working as a band singer, Eden took up residence at Hollywood's Studio Club, an inexpensive rooming house for aspiring actresses. Other Studio Club residents would note in later years that Eden would look at the club's bulletin board and apply for every show business job available, even those that she was advised would "ruin" her career. Persistence paid off, and in 1956 Eden made her film debut in Back from Eternity. She worked steadily in television, finally attaining leading-lady status on the 1958 sitcom How to Marry a Millionaire, in which she played a myopic "Marilyn Monroe"-type golddigger. Good film and TV roles followed for the lovely blonde actress, and full stardom arrived with the NBC comedy series I Dream of Jeannie. Eden played the curvaceous bottle imp from 1965-70, reviving the character in a brace of TV movies, the last one produced in 1991. Eden's post-Jeannie career has included several films, TV guest star appearances, theatrical and nightclub engagements, and still another sitcom, 1981's Harper Valley P.T.A. _ Hal Erickson PLEASE READ: I do not utilize at this time the optional "checking out" feature displayed on my item description page by EBAY.

Besides hosting, Karloff also stars in 3 of the 4 episodes featured here, making it a must see for fans. you get: 1) DESTINATION NIGHTMARE 2) SUMMER HEAT 3) THE RETURN OF MADAME VERNOY (featuring George Hamilton) 4) JACK THE RIPPER Almost two hours of rare Karloff!

    <Description>This is a new Sealed screener vhs video.It is Hard Core Logo.Hard Core Logo is often compared to This Is Spinal Tap--and for marketing purposes, that makes sense: both are pretend documentaries about rock bands (a self-important heavy metal crew in Spinal Tap, a self-destructing punk mob in Hard Core Logo). But though Hard Core Logo can be cuttingly funny, it's not really a comedy; it's a piercing examination of friendship and betrayal, success and self-hatred, and everything that fueled punk rock. Lead singer Joe Dick (Hugh Dillon) uses false pretenses to convince guitarist Billy Tallent (Callum Keith Rennie) to reform Hard Core Logo for a reunion tour across Canada, followed by a film crew (featuring director Bruce McDonald, whose other films include Roadkill and Highway 61, as himself). Tallent agrees, but only because he expects to be joining a much more successful rock group very shortly and sees this as a favor to Dick. As they travel from town to town, their relationship unravels, as does the psyche of bass player John Oxenberger (John Pyper-Ferguson). The performances are astonishingly genuine; even the oafish drummer Pipefitter (Bernie Coulson) becomes three-dimensional. By the end, you'll believe in them so much as people that the band's disintegration is truly wrenching. A remarkable film, both comic and sad. Check out my other vhs auctions.</Description>

    <Description>This is a previously viewed, former rental copy of The Twilight Zone: Volume 1 on VHS. This video contains two episodes. They are 1)Agnes Moorehead starring in The Invaders, and 2)Gladys Johnson and Robert Redford starring in Nothing In the Dark. This video is currently out-of-print and is very tough to find. This box has been CUT for rental purposes and has been slipped into a durable, plastic case for protection. Shipping and handling charges are as follows. (In the U.S.: $4.00 with an option for insurance costing an additional $1.10) (Canada: $4.50) (Europe and Australia: $9.50). MEDIA RATE is no longer available from the U.S. Post Office for shipping videocassettes. All videos will be sent out via First Class or Priority Mail. A 10 day wait for clearance will be observed on all personal checks. For faster service, the high bidder can pay by credit card at www.bidpay.com or at www.paypal.com. All videos are guaranteed to work or else you get your money back. Feel free to contact me with any questions you might have. All winning bidders will be contacted within 3 days of the auction_s end, and a return email is also expected. I will always post Positive Feedback for paying customers! Please check out my other auctions for other great, hard-to-find movies and videos. If you should win 2 or 3 of my auctions, you will save some money on the shipping costs. Thanks and Good Luck!</Description>

    <Description>******ALL PHOTOS ARE 8X10_S.****** Hi everyone, this is Amy from EBAY POWERSELLER CELEBSIGN, I created this account 2nd account to sell strictly preprints to help myself stay more organized. I run up to 400 items per week and by splitting up my items I will be better able to serve you. You will receive your items quicker by allowing me to split the work of processing orders among my partners. Theses preprints are among the best quality I have ever seen and are exact replicas of the original Hand Signed Versions that I have in my display cases covering the walls of my home and office space. Many of these original photos are worth over $100.00 and here you can have an exact replica for a fraction of the cost. I promise 99.9% of the people who receive these photos have a very very very hard time telling the difference from the original hand signed one. These things are so damn good that even I can barely tell the difference from the originals when they are both in my hand, and when they are hanging onm the wall in a picture frame it is virtually impossible. These replicas are wonderful for bars, restaurants, club houses, ect where theft is a possibility. Customers will think they are real and it one gets stolen or damaged it not like your out hundreds of dollars. Shipping is $2.00 no matter how many you buy!!! $5.00 outside USA. I CAN ONLY TAKE MONEY ORDERS, CASH, OR PAYPALL FOR THIS ACCOUNT, NO CHECKS!!!!! MY PAYPALL ACCOUNT IS EBAY7380@AOL.COM</Description>

    <Description>Aah-oooo! Talk about a howling success! I Was A Teenage Werewolf is one of the best-known cult classics ever. Teenage Werewolf created a trailblazing tale of terror that inspired waves of "transformed teen" movies. Michael Landon (Little House on the Prarie, Bonanza, Highway to Heaven) made his first starring role one to remember. He brings a fierce intensity to the role of Tony, a likeable high-schooler prone to outbursts of violence. A psychiatrist (Whit Bissell) treats Tony for his aggression, but the treatment is worse than the "disease." Tony becomes a werewolf...and begins a murderous spree that makes his past behavior look like a stroll in the park. Carloads of alienated teens sympathetic to Tony's plight didn't wait for the moon to be full before heading out to see this gem. In less than a year from its release, I Was A Teenage Werewolf grossed more than ten times its costs! RCA Columbia Pictures Home Video. Black &amp; White. Hi-Fi. VHS. Cat # 60906. Previously viewed. Stickers/slightly imperfect video cover. Starring: Michael Landon, Yvonne Lime, Whit Bissell, Tony Marshall. Buyer pays actual shipping costs.

    <Description>CHARMED "Enter the Demon" Season 4, Episode 5 Storyline: When making a potion, a put-upon Paige wishes to have a life like the more experienced Phoebe and inadvertently switches bodies with her. While they cover the switch up so Piper doesn't get angry, Piper herself gets involved with a Chinese Zen Master. His student, Yen Lo, has turned to the dark side and been "killed" by the Master's daughter, but is managing to stay alive by hiding out in limbo. Yen Lo takes his former master prisoner and holds him in Limbo, then goes after the daughter (he can emerge into the real world temporarily through puddles of water). Paige and Phoebe deal with each other's romantic entanglements, then figure out how to switch souls back. They then use the potion to switch Piper's soul with the Master's, and he helps them get to Limbo and defeat Yen Lo and send him on to his next karmic life. Description: This is an Original script. This is only given to actors and crew members. Industry format: Colored Revision Pages "Rainbow" Script. 56 pages and is held together with 2 brass clips. September 12, 2001.

    <Description>KEVIN POLLACK SIGNED USUAL SUSPECTS PIC W/PRF _ Description ***Please read entire description for valuable authenticity information**** You are currently bidding for a signed 8x10 picture from the movie Usual Suspects signed by Kevin Pollack. I obtained this piece in Toronto in August 1996. I have over 9 years of experience in obtaining in-person autographs and can quote where and when each one of my items was signed. In-person means that the person that is selling the item witnessed it been signed and can give you an exact location and date as to where the item was signed and even in many instances provide you with some sort of photographic evidence of the meeting. With this said please be extremely cautious when bidding on any autographed items on eBay. Ask the seller where and when the item was signed and who witnessed it being signed. In a recent investigation conducted by the FBI, Internal Revenue Service and U.S. Attorney_s Office code-named "Operation Bullpen" released in April 2000 it stated: "The sports and celebrity memorabilia market in the United States is approximately one billion dollars per year. Industry experts estimate that upwards of 50% (and perhaps as much as 90%) of the items comprising this market are counterfeit." The report went on to say: "If the price is too good to be true, it is probably a fake". This means that potential bidders should question the authenticity of all high-end items that are up on eBay for ridiculously low market prices. From my experience I know that celebrity, musical and sports related autographs are not easy to obtain and when I obtain them it is in extreme limited quantities; hence they command high selling prices to reflect and compensate for the difficulty in obtaining these signatures. Should you have any questions regarding this auction or with regards to authenticity in general please do not hesitate to send us your questions at: jponte@netzero.net. Note: Shipping for this item is $5 anywhere in North America and varies abroad. The authenticity photo it's not included with the item.Good luck and remember to check out other auctions by "auctioner10" .

This is the great Rolling Thunder Home Video Release of JACK HILL'S SWITCHBLADE SISTERS So easy to kill. So hard to love. The Silver Daggers are a gang of young hoods who control an inner-city high school, where they sell drugs and sex to the student body and fight anyone who gets in their way. The Daggers have a ladies' auxiliary, The Dagger Debs, who rumble just as hard as the men, but one day chief Dagger Deb Lace meets her match in Maggie, a new kid who won't back down. When a scuffle lands Maggie and the Debs in jail for the night, Maggie comes to Lace's rescue, and Maggie becomes Lace's new right-hand woman. However, fellow Deb Patch is jealous of Maggie's friendship with Lace, and begins spinning a web of deceit to destroy Lace's trust in the new deb. In the midst of the infighting, the Silver Daggers find their turf challenged by a rival gang who pose as a community action team, and the Debs join forces with a revolutionary political group. Don't miss your chance to own this cult classic written and directed by Jack Hill!

If you don't buy now you are passing up a great opportunity. Please do not ask for scans or copies of these items because I can not do it. Sorry!

    <Description>Oscar winner Whoopi Goldberg stars as a sassy, low-rent lounge singer forced to hide out from the mob in the last place on Earth anyone would look for her - a quiet religious convent. There, her irreverent behavior attracts a flock of faithful followers - and before long she turns the nuns' tone-deaf choir into a soulful chorus of swingin', singin' sistas. But when the group earns rave reviews, her sudden celebrity jeopardizes her hidden identity. A divine comedy that bursts with '60s Motown hits. Also starring Maggie Smith, Harvey Keitel, and Kathy Najimy. Color, VHS (Touchstone Home Video). Running time: 100 minutes. Comes in original box, which is in overall good condition. Video viewed once. Buyer to pay $3.00 postage, seller accepts PayPal and money orders only. Thanks! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>videostogo videostogo VIDEOS-TO-GO THE WHISTLE BLOWER OUT-OF-PRINT Superpatriotic Briton Michael Caine learns from his son Nigel Havers, a Russian translator with Government Communications Headquarters, that the CIA might have ordered the deaths of some GCH employees to avoid any security leaks. When Havers mentions that he's thinking about blowing the whistle on the sordid goings-on, Caine, convinced that whatever the CIA is doing is for the greatest good, implores his son to keep quiet. Soon afterward, Havers is found murdered. Even after this, Caine refuses to think ill of his government and its allies. It takes the death of investigative reporter James Fox to shake Caine out of his self-denial and to confront the persons responsible for the killings within the GCH. The venerable John Gielgud offers a surprising characterization in this complex conspiracy thriller.

    <Description>TWIST AROUND THE CLOCK HERALD This is an ORIGINAL HERALD from the 1940-50's era. This is part of a WAREHOUSE FIND from the original printer who printed these Heralds for DRIVE IN and MOVIE THEATERS in the south. Many of these are from LONG AGO CLOSED DRIVE IN THEATERS in THE TAMPA FL area. These are 100 % original and are not reprints or copies. THESE ARE THE REAL THING. These were all printed in the late 40's to the early 60's. Most of these are from the ORIGINAL RELEASE of the film. Not the re-release. For those who do not know or are too young to remember what HERALDS are here is a bit of history on them. Heralds were given to patrons (also sometimes mailed) to let them now about upcoming films that were going to play at that theater. Many had menus on them to advertise concession items but the main purpose of them was to promote upcoming films. These were a common item in the 50's and 60's at most drive ins. But no more. Now they are quite scarce and uncommon. These look great in frames. No movie paper collection is complete without some heralds as they are a part of movie history. Here is your chance to own a part of that history. Many of these heralds we only have one or two of. Some a few more then that but overall there is not a lot on any one title. Once these are gone that's it. Winning bid adds $5.00 postage(Shipping out of the U.S. cost more!) which includes insurance. Checks take 1 week to clear with packages going out within 15-20 days after that. Money orders go out within 15-20 days from receipt. We ship items out in the order they come in..

The funds clear alot sooner than Billpoint, which means your DVD can get shipped quicker. I cannot accept Money Orders or Checks. Please allow 2-3 weeks for delivery after funds have cleared. Thank you!</Description>

    <Description>You are bidding on the VHS movie of "Beau Travail", starring DENIS LAVANT (the star of "Lovers on the Bridge"), MICHEL SUBOR (star of "The Little Soldier") and GREGOIRE COLIN (of "The Dreamlife of Angels" fame). The film was masterfully directed by CLAIRE DENIS, who has directed several terrifc films including "Nenette et Boni", and "Contre L'Oubli". Based loosely on Herman Melville's novella, "Billy Budd", this film tells the story of an ex-Foreign Legion officer, Galoup, as he recalls his once glorious life, leading troops in the Gulf of Djibouti. His existence there was happy, strict and regimented, but the arrival of a promising young recruit, Sentain, plants the seeds of jealousy in Galoup's mind. Galoup feels compelled to rid the troop of Sentain, especially after Sentain becomes the object of affection of the High Commandant, who Galoup greatly admires. Ultimately, Galoup's jealousy leads to the destruction of both Sentain and himself. This film is worth seeing just for the final scene in which the reserved Galoup gets spastic! This video is in the French language with English subtitles. The video was once a rental but it is in excellent condition. It comes in its original box and there is a rental sticker affixed to the videotape. The video is in the NTSC format so it will play in all North American VCRs. Synopsis: This simmering drama is an exploration of moral and social values. Filled with implied eroticism, it's a rumination on the bitter predicament of a man stewing in petty jealousy that turns to murderous hate. It's a beautiful film to watch as it captures the drills and training regimens of shirtless, muscular young men as forms of dance. The focus is on a troubled sergeant, Galoup (Denis Lavant), and his irrational dislike for a raw recruit, Gilles Sentain (Gregoire Colin), whom he sees as an untrustworthy misfit. For his part, Sentain is entirely dutiful. But the sergeant is poised to destroy him in a classic struggle of good and evil. The film's vision of military men devoted to meaningless tasks, and constantly preparing for combat with an unseen enemy, is haunting, as is the resentment of the sergeant cast out from the tight community of the lesser ranked. His commander is Bruno Forestier (Michel Subor), a brooding careerist who has lost all sense of military purpose.

    <Description>Peter Fonda known in turn as Henry Fonda's Son and Jane Fonda's Brother stepped out of the Shadow's of his Famous Family when he became The Counter-Culture ICON Captain America. To Commemorate his part in this Cult Classic Peter Issued a VERY LIMITED Edition (Tag Bears his Name) of the Leather Jacket he wore for his role. IT IS IDENTICAL!! AND IT IS INCREDIBLE!! I purchased this Jacket for a pretty hefty sum because I LOVE Captain America and although as a woman it was too long and too tight across the "top" that SOMEHOW I would "grow" into it and when I did I would walk down the street and everyone would know that I was CAPTAIN-TESSA AMERICA!!(That's like a French Countessa only American Style). Well it STILL does not fit me!! I just cannot let this SUPER HANDSOME JACKET hang in the Closet another minute when some CAPTAIN AMERICA would love to own it! It is made of BUTTER SOFT LEATHER. Jackets don't get any more Patriotic than this with the Black Leather Background, The Red Leather, Blue Leather,The White Leather.. and The Red White and Blue Flag on the Back!! It is a JACKET that you may never again see on Ebay! Leather Stripes in Red, White and Blue down the front side and a band of the same on the left arm. A LARGE Cloth American Flag on the back. Check out the NEAT Medallion on the Front! The measurements are: Length::: 21 Inches from the back collar to the hem. Shoulder::21 Inches between back arm seams. Chest THIS IS THE IMPORTANT ONE:: 22 1/2 Inches between armpit seam, across the front. I believe that makes it a Mans 44-46. Sleeves:: 24 1/2 Inches from shoulder seam to cuff. Zippered side Pockets, Sleeve Closures, Inside Pocket. It does and has everything you need!! CONDITION IS FLAWLESS!! Worn once or twice and the little flag on Peters Leather Name tag is slightly separated..NOT of ANY importance BUT I always mention the tiny details. I would be be embarrassed to tell you how much I paid for this Jacket so let's just say that my reserve of $350.00 is a BARGAIN!! A once in a lifetime chance to own the Captain America Leather Jacket AND guess what!! IT IS MADE IN AMERICA!! WOW!! Winner to pay $8.50 S&amp;H to the States ONLY and mandatory insurance based on the winning bid. I want to thank you for looking at my site and would like to wish everyone a VERY Happy Holiday Season. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>More ABBA Gold Arguably, the major musical event of 1992/3 was the renaissance of ABBA, whose 'ABBA GOLD - GREATEST HITS' album and video, topped the UK charts and the charts of a dozen other countries around the world. Not bad for a group that effectively went its separate ways ten years before...However, they are without any doubt, among the ten most popular acts of the entire history of modern pop/rock music and the fact that their time came round again in 1992 (just as it had for so many acts from the golden era of pop music), should cause no raising of eyebrows. After twenty years during which ABBA left a permanent mark on the history of pop music, their international popularity shows little sign of diminishing. The Video Quality is very good and it comes in a hard clamshell case with full color artwork cover. Buyer pays $4.00 shipping/handling in the US. (media mail) Out of the US please contact me for shipping cost. I do accept: Personal Check, Monay Order and Pay Pal for your Visa Mastercard purchases but the buyer must agree to pay any related fees if this is YOUR choice of payment . Insurance is recommended. I cannot be responsible for mistakes by the Post Office if you choose not to insure. Thank you for looking. I can combine shipping on multiple auctions.

Shipping costs are $30. _ Email _me with further questions. The story behind the painting In the summer of 1888, Van Gogh interrupted his work on landscapes and portraits, and turned to make a few still lifes. These were the sunflowers which, more than any other of his paintings, have made him known throughout the world. They are often the only works with which Van Gogh is identified. Vincent mentioned the idea of painting sunflowers in a letter to his friend, the painter Emile Bernard, written in August: _I am thinking about hanging half a dozen paintings of sunflowers in my studio, a decoration in which unmixed or broken chromatic yellows will shine from various backgrounds, blue, from the palest Veronese to royal blue, framed with wooden slats painted orange. The same kind of effect as stained-glass windows in a gothic church._ The thought of Gauguin had a decisive influence on this too. Vincent wrote a letter to his brother Theo, saying that they were intended for Gauguin: _I am painting with the enthusiasm of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which will not surprise you, since what it is all about painting large sunflowers. A few days later Vincent reported: _ I am now working on the fourth painting of the sunflowers. This fourth one is a bouquet of fourteen flowers with quinces and lemons that I did much earlier. But because it is much larger, it is quite impressive, and I believe that this time it is painted with more simplicity than the quinces and the lemons._ There is no doubt that Vincent meant the painting we are discussing here.

    <Description>Enjoy. Great condition, and great series. Shipping: $5.00 I accept payment through only TWO methods. Paypal, or money order. I, unfortunately, have no way to accept other methods of payment.. Please don't bid if you can't pay through those 2 methods. Thank you, and happy bidding. ^^; Do not bid if you have NEGATIVE, or NO positive feedback. While I accept M.O.'s, I *will not* wait more then two weeks for them. It's a pain. Keep this in mind, or use paypal. :) All sales are final!</Description>

These are recorded in MP3 format and are playable on computers with MP3 programs or portable CD players with MP3 technology. (I want to add a note about MP3 as opposed to Real Audio. When I began collecting radio shows on CDs, I bought Real Audio, but soon discovered the better quality of MP3, and also that most collectors prefer MP3. All shows are in the better MP3.) (SELLING IN USA ONLY; NO INTERNATIONAL ORDERS, THANKS.) Shipping is $3.50 for Priority Mail. Combine winning auctions and pay only one shipping charge. I accept Paypal. I believe these shows are in public domain.</Description>

    <Description>Highlights from two Cher Show 1975 episodes, with Cher in all her Bob Mackie designed glory. These two shows were rebroadcast on cable, and trimmed down to the best moments. One episode is from the first season and one is from the second, so you get to see both openings. The producer was George Schlatter, who'd done very well with "Laugh-In." The tape starts with an episode from the second season, which originally aired on Oct. 12, 1975. The guests are Anthony Newley and the Ike and Tina Turner Revue, and here are the highlights from this show: Cher sings "There'll Be Some Changes Made" in a glitter pantsuit Anthony Newley sings a number from the 1975 musical version of "The Old Curiosity Shop" Ike and Tina Turner do a really fast musical number called "Baby, Get It On" Cher and Tina perform the duet "Country Side of Life" while dressed in amazing feathered outfits Cher and Ike do a brief comedy routine There's a big musical number based on Neil Diamond's "Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show" which starts with Newley doing the song while dressed as Brother Love, then Cher and Tina come out in glitter ensembles to "testify" that they used to do the "hoochie-coo," and there's a big finish with "Resurrection Shuffle" and "Saved," done with a stageful of dancers. The second show on the tape is the special that kicked off the first season of the show. It first aired on Feb. 12, 1975. The guests were Bette Midler, Elton John, and Flip Wilson. The highlights include: Cher opens the show with "Let Me Entertain You" Elton John appears in an enormous hat and collar, both in silver lame, making him look like a blend of the witch from Snow White, Queen Elizabeth I, and a Keebler elf. He and Cher perform "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds." My favorite part of this show is Cher as Laverne Lashinsky at her high school reunion, where she meets Flip Wilson doing his Geraldine Jones routine. Laverne looks fabulous in her dangly ball earrings, leopard-skin print dress, and cat's eye glasses, while Geraldine has tastefully donned short white gloves a la Jackie Kennedy Cher performs "All in Love Is Fair" on a set decorated with asparagus ferns hanging in macrama hangers; Cher appears to be wearing matching macrame earrings Cher was not allowed to do the "Vamps" routine from the old Sonny and Cher show, so instead she and Bette do a "Trashy Ladies" medley, which included "A Lady with a Touch of Trash," "I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate," "Lulu's Back in Town," "True Blue Lou," "Put the Blame on Mame," "Minnie the Moocher," "Sweet Georgia Brown," and other songs. Bette and Cher are dressed in garter belts, high heels, and feather boas, and they do lots of physical comedy and lots of high kicks. They top off the number by shaking the tassels on their derrieres. Cher does her "Saturday Night" skit, coming home from a date with a wolf, making herself a snack she can't eat because of the calories, and cuddling up to her electric blanket Elton and Cher perform "Bennie and the Jets" Flip, Bette, Cher, and Elton are hilarious in a rest home comedy skit, wearing old people makeup and padding Elton cracks Cher up so much she can't stop laughing The show closes with a medley done with a striped piano amid hundreds of pastel balloons, and Elton dressed up in the style of the Mad Hatter, but in white. Bette, Cher, and Flip are also dressed in white outfits trimmed out with lots of glitter as they perform "Mockingbird," "Proud Mary," "Ain't No Mountain High Enough," and "Never Can Say Goodbye." The photo below is from this medley. The tape ends with a few minutes from a TV special on Bette Midler's career Tape comes in a plain box. Ships for $1.75 book rate in the US.

    <Description>Desert Bloom starring Jon Voight, Jobeth Williams, Ellen Barkin and Allen Garfield. VHS, previously viewed. Set against the dawn of the Atomic Age in l950's Las Vegas, "Desert Bloom" is a powerful human drama, painting an unforgettable portrait of a family struggling to unite in an increasingly frightening world. Jon Voight is Jack Chismore, a volatile war veteran, fighting to overcome his personal demons while holding his family together; JOBETH WILLIAMS is his wife Lily, torn between the needs of her family and a secret vice that threatens the very foundation of her marriage; Annabeth Gish is Rose, a delicate girl on the threshold of adolescence, struggling to understand the adults surrounding her. Into this turbulent household comes Lily's sister Starr, Ellen Barkin, a sexy divorcee who becomes the unwitting catalyst in an explosive chain reaction that rocks the Chismore family as surely--and irrevocably as the A-bomb testing in the nearby desert. Sensitively directed, brilliantly acted and superbly written, "Desert Bloom" is a compelling study of a family's survival and triumph in a swiftly changing world.

    <Description>Bruce Hershenson Vintage Movie Posters and Movie Poster Books Every item has a low opening bid and NO RESERVE! No questions asked return policy on EVERY item! Best Packaging and Quickest Shipping on eBay! 99.96% customers satisfied in over 30,000 eBay transactions! Full-Time movie poster dealer since 1989; over 16 million dollars of sales! Publisher of 30 full-color movie poster books (over 210,000 copies sold)! Complete Set of 14 Original Vintage Theater-Used Lobby Cards in the Original Mailing Envelope (Each card measures 11" x 14") Film: Patton, the 1970 Franklin J. Schaffner war drama (written by Francis Ford Coppola, Ladislas Farago, and Omar N. Bradley) starring George C. Scott, Karl Malden, Michael Bates, Ed Binns, and Stephen Young. The bottom of the original mailing envelope (and the bottom of the back of each card) reads, "Patton, 20th Century Fox, Printed in Italy by Rotograph - Roma 1969". These were printed in Italy because the Italian printers got much finer reproduction than American printers at that time. You will not believe the quality of these lobby cards! Condition &amp; Defects: near mint! Buy this item now! This means that after you place your bid, the auction stops and you immediately purchase this item for the starting price. There is no waiting days until the end of the auction to hope you've won! Be sure to look at our other eBay offerings. Each of our items ALWAYS contain an ACTUAL image of the item for sale, not a reference photo of a similar item we, or someone else, has sold in the past. (See the image below; glare on an image is from the camera, not the item(s).) ORIGINAL VINTAGE LOBBY CARDS MAKE GREAT HOLIDAY GIFTS! There is virtually no chance that the hard to shop for person you are looking to buy a gift for will have these original vintage lobby cards, and they are surprisingly affordable. If you buy this item now, we will ship it so it arrives in time for Christmas (&amp; we will only charge you the actual cost of sending the item)! Click here to view our other current eBay items! Our Feedback Policy We only leave feedback on those who leave feedback on us. The reason we leave feedback in this manner is both because we don't consider a transaction "completed" until the buyer has decided they are happy with their purchase, and also because we sell so many items (usually 500+ a week) that it would require an extra employee if we had to leave feedback first, and that would mean raising our prices, which we don't want to do. All but a handful of our 10,000+ customers are understanding on this and are willing to leave feedback first. If you are one of the few people who insist on feedback being left as soon as you make payment, PLEASE DO NOT BID ON ANY OF THE ITEMS WE SELL ON eBAY. Shipping Terms Payment Options IMPORTANT! Please read our Shipping Terms before bidding! U.S. only : The shipping is $7, if sending it by Ground UPS will get it there on time. IF FASTER DELIVERY IS REQUIRED, WE WILL ONLY CHARGE YOU THE EXACT ACTUAL COST OF SENDING THE ITEM (&amp; YOU CAN CHOOSE THE WAY TO SEND). Click HERE to learn about our shipping methods, which many of our 10,000+ satisfied customers call the best on eBay! NON-U.S. Orders: Click HERE to learn how much we will charge to ship this item. Sometimes it is expensive to send an order to a non-U.S. destination, ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT IT SENT VIA A EXPRESS (2-DAY) METHOD. BEFORE YOU PLACE A BID, MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH THE SHIPPING WILL BE! Orders from outside the U.S. must specify surface mail or Airmail (these are the only two available options for non-U.S. orders), and they will be charged the actual postal cost only (if they pay by credit card). If you are paying by money order, e-mail us for the shipping charges of your purchase. Orders to Canada can only be sent via Airmail! We accept Visa/MasterCard, Paypal, check, or money order. If you pay with cash, we are not responsible if the cash doesn't reach us safely!

    <Description>IMPORTANTES! IMPORTANTI! WICHTIGE! BELANGRIJKE! Before bidding on this item, you must be prepared to make a prompt credit card payment thru CCNOW, please read and understand all the auction terms. GOT IT....? GOOD, ROCK ON! For Mad Max on DVD. Mel Gibson's breakthrough role as the renegade highway patrolman, seeking revenge against the Toecutter and gang for the murder of his wife and child. It's bikers versus crooked cops in a post-apocalyptic future! This is of course different from the region 1 DVDs, with only overdubbed audio. Previously offered on VCD, I just got DVDs and to be doubly sure I tested one myself. The back cover indicates 2 English audio tracks, and indeed, it is quite obvious upon listening that one is Australian! Put anudda shrimp on the barbie! Don't take chances, it's either the import Japanese, Australian, or this one. China DVDs?? No way, 'mate'!! The menu is in English. 93 mins. running time. Widescreen, scene access. Brand new, shrinkwrapped! Special features: Theatrical Trailer NOTE: This is a code-free DVD playable worldwide. SUPERIOR SERVICE GUARANTEES respond to all e-mail ship promptly upon receipt of payment npb and negative feedback for non-paying bidders so PLEASE consider carefully before bidding! PAYMENT Visa, MC, Amex, Discover, thru CCNOW (www.ccnow.com) 3rd party auction payment service. Absolutely secure one-time transaction, simple to use and you get your item faster. No registration required, no fees charged. Seller never gets the buyer_s payment details. Works like Billpoint, you get an e-invoice, you pay at secure checkout, and you_re set. Cash is accepted by REGISTERED MAIL ONLY . Be informed that it is relatively expensive to mail a registered letter but there is no other way to send cash. I must repeat, no other way. Sent regular mail it will be stolen. Even so, cash is sent at bidder_s risk. Due to high bank charges and inadequacies of certain services to provide for international sellers, these forms of payment are sadly UNACCEPTABLE: PAYPAL BILLPOINT BIDPAY MONEY ORDERS OF ANY KIND CHEQUES OF ANY KIND For UK or Singapore bidders alternate forms of payment exist, please e-mail for info. Bidders from other countries welcome to discuss alternate forms of payment BEFORE bidding. SHIPPING All items bubble-wrapped, and shipped REGISTERED AIRMAIL to ensure a safe delivery.

    <Description>IMPORTANTES! IMPORTANTI! WICHTIGE! BELANGRIJKE! Before bidding on this item, you must be prepared to make a prompt credit card payment thru CCNOW, please read and understand all the auction terms. This is a VCD, not a DVD! Please read my VCD policy for a better understanding. GOT IT....? GOOD, ROCK ON! For Judas Priest Live, on VCD. Priest still rocks!! Rob Halford is THE metal voice, and he's screaming for vengeance here.....Great twinwork as always from Tipton/Downing. Priest inspired everyone from Venom to Slayer!! This is a great concert featuring all classic songs, out of print since Rob went bald. The encore culminates in Rob riding his bike onstage! You won't need no parental guidance! Pure metal madness!! Some points to consider about ambiguous DVD auctions for this concert, I would consider that there is no official DVD release as yet, and no special features as would be expected of a DVD. What kind of DVD would that be? No pics of the actual item provided? Does the quality justify the price? I can guarantee the same quality on this VCD. Like all my auctions this ships in a sturdy jewel case, not just a flimsy plastic sleeve, to protect the disc from getting smashed to pieces in transit. The Hellion/Electric Eye Riding On the Wind Heading Out To The Highway Metal Gods Bloodstone Breaking The Law The Sinner Desert Plains The Ripper Diamonds And Rust Devil's Child Screaming For Vengeance You've Got Another Thing Coming Hell Bent For Leather VIDEO CD POLICY VCDs can be viewed on almost all DVD players, NO regional code meaning all-regions playable, just check for the VCD function in your user manual Can also be played on PCs with free MPEG software such as Windows Media Player, Sony Videopress or Xing Mpeg If you_re unsure as to whether or not your DVD player/PC plays VCDs please be responsible and find out before bidding These VCDs are BRAND NEW, pictures show a test copy These VCDs are factory-pressed not CD-Rs Please ask questions prior to bidding if you have any concerns SUPERIOR SERVICE GUARANTEES respond to all e-mail ship promptly upon receipt of payment positive feedback upon receipt of prompt payment (not true of all sellers) npb and negative feedback for non-paying bidders so PLEASE consider carefully before bidding! PAYMENT Visa, MC, Amex, Discover, thru CCNOW (www.ccnow.com) 3rd party auction payment service. Absolutely secure one-time transaction, simple to use and you get your item faster. No registration required, no fees charged. Seller never gets the buyer_s payment details. Works like Billpoint, you get an e-invoice, you pay at secure checkout, and you_re set.

Sent regular mail it will be stolen. Even so, cash is sent at bidder_s risk. Due to high bank charges and inadequacies of certain services to provide for international sellers, these forms of payment are sadly UNACCEPTABLE: PAYPAL BILLPOINT BIDPAY MONEY ORDERS OF ANY KIND CHEQUES OF ANY KIND For UK or Singapore bidders alternate forms of payment exist, please e-mail for info. Bidders from other countries welcome to discuss alternate forms of payment BEFORE bidding. SHIPPING All items bubble-wrapped, and shipped REGISTERED AIRMAIL to ensure a safe delivery.
