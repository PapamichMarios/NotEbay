THIS JADE BANGLE IS PERFECT!! 100% NATURAL BURMESE JADE COLOR (NO DYE), GOOD TRANSLUCENT QUALITY, AND THERE ARE NO FLAWS OR FRACTURES THROUGHOUT. THE BANGLE IS JUST STUNNING IN EVERY WAY AND EVEN THOUGH THE PICTURE HERE IS A GOOD ONE BUT IT STILL CANNOT DO THE ITEM ANY JUSTICE TO THE GORGEOUS COLORS. THE SIZE IS 2 1/2 INCHES ID. THIS BURMESE JADE BANGLE SHOULD RETAIL FOR ABOUT $450.00 OR MORE IN ANY GOOD JEWELRY STORE THAT SELLS FINE JADE. I HAVE ABOUT 15 OF THESE BANGLES ALL CUT FROM THE SAME STONE AND WILL BE USING THIS PICTURE FOR ALL SINCE THEY ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE, MOST WILL HAVE THREE GREEN SPOTS LIKE THE PICTURE AND JUST A FEW HAVE ONLY TWO GREEN SPOTS. OTHER THAN THAT THEY ARE THE SAME IN COLOR AND QUALITY AND SIZE. THISIS YOUR CHANCE TO OWN A VERY FINE PERFECT BURMESE LAVENDER JADE BANGLE AT A FRACTION OF THE TRUE RETAIL PRICE If you have any questions about Jade Grade's or qualities, I will be happy to e mail you back with anwers to any of your questions regarding this subject &amp; what they mean. It is also worth bearing in mind when buying Jade that somewhere in the region of 85% of the Jade sold in the retail jewelry stores are treated in some way whether they tell you or NOT, indeed even if they know it themselfs !! It has been my personal experience that most jeweler's have very little or no knowledge at all about Jade, even though they say they do. I have been a direct importer of fine Jade jewelry for over ten years now, I personally travel to Burma, Thailand, &amp; China to hand pick all my Jade items for sale. It has taken me years to know the grades and differant qualities of Jade, and I have learned from the old masters in the orient, not in some classroom. Thanks for your time and I hope I can be of some help to any of my customer's. I NOW ACCEPT VISA AND MASTERCARD PAYMENT THROUGH PAYPAL.COM. IT IS FREE, FAST, EASY AND VERY SECURE.

    <Description>This is an excellent condition Armani Exchange A/X navy wool pea coat in size large which is slightly a longer length than a bomber jacket. (Car Coat length). It is made of a heavy wool. It is a beautiful fall/winter color and just a true classic. Note that it has four patch pockets in the front with snap closures, and there is a small midline vent in the back. Made of the typical urban materials signature of Armani Exchange. The jacket is fully lined and there is padding also. Beautiful winter/fall/early spring coat which you can wear with literally ANYTHING! The lining of the jacket is 54% acetate/46% nylon, and the padding (filling of the jacket) is 100% polyester. The shell of the jacket (the part which is on the outside is 80%wool/20% nylon. The added nylon to the shell is VERY helpful because it prevents the wool from pilling into furballs. Any flaws seen in the photos are due solely to the resolution of the digital camera. All buttons are intact!. I purchased this jacket from A/X for about $200. The measurements of the jacket: Armpit to armpit across the chest = 24.5inches; bottom of the collar to end of the jacket = 35 inches in length. Great bargain! Goes nicely with black or grey or even khakis. I accept money order or Paypal only. Please email seller with any additional questions. Lucky bidder pays an additional $8.00 for 2nd day priority shipping with delivery confirmation. No reserve!</Description>

    <Description>This is a very in-style short-sleeved men's XL Tommy Hilfiger shirt. It is navy with a white collar and white/navy striping at the arms. The front left of the shirt has "Hilfiger Varsity Sports" embroidered on and "Hilfiger" is embroidered on the back in 3" letters. It has a snap closure and 7" zipper in the front -- both are very much in style now. The shirt is 100% cotton and all tags are still attatched. The tag says: "Values up to $88 Our price $49.99". I have seen these shirts priced in the $80+ range but this specific one was purchased at an outlet for $49.99 + tax. This would make a great gift -- no one would know that you didn't pay retail at a department store. I normally ship on the day payment (paypal or m.o.) is received but hold items until personal checks clear. U.S. shipping is $5.50. I have other XL NWT auctions that you may be interested in (Ralph Lauren, Starter, Reebok) and happily combine shipping for multiple auction winners. Thanks for looking!!

The sweater has red knit elbow pads on each arm and nice black and white ribbed cuffs. It has 4 black buttons on the front. The sweater is free from stains and pulls and only has a very small amount of fuzzing (the spot in the picture is from my camera). Great with a pair of black pants and a white turtleneck for the holidays! If this wasn't exactly what you were looking for, please check out my other auctions (it is my about me page so just scroll down to see the auctions). I am constantly adding new things and there just might be another auction with something you might like. Let me dismiss with all the formalities.... All clothes come from a nonsmoking home. We do have a doggie but please don't worry it won't be covered in Corgi hair, he doesn't help me pack. I try really hard to describe things and the flaws, if something is missed it isn't intentional. I won't sell anything that isn't in a condition I would personally wear (or wear on my children). If you have any questions please email me, I'll try to get back to you right away. Shipping: The winning bidder to pay actual cost for shipping (priority of first class if light enough and desired by bidder), I don't believe in charging a handling fee. If you win more than one auction I can combine the items to save on shipping. Insurance is optional but strongly suggested, I cannot be held responsible USPS problems, I try to pack very securely but if they damage it or lose it...well please think about insurance. Payments: I accept Paypal, cashiers checks, and money orders. No personal checks, sorry. Contact to be made within 3 days of the auction's close with payment to be received within 14 days of closing.

You'd be surprised at the number of winning bidders who dis appear off the face of the earth after they win.

    <Description>I was inspired by the vivid colors of ancient Egyptian jewelry in designing this necklace. The centerpiece is a finely detailed pendant of the Goddess Hathor, patroness of women and all things beautiful. I've added 2 sterling feathers, the ancient Egyptian symbol of Truth, and used one of their favorite combinations of gemstones, cobalt-blue lapis and faceted red carnelian. Lapis was considered the stone of the gods in Egyptian society. All hang from a sterling 16" chain. This necklace is beautifully vivid in its color, and really lights up the face.

There is no delivery confirmation available on this and packages in rare instances have taken up to two weeks to arrive (way less than 1% of the time).

Priority mail shipping with a delivery confirmation number sent to you is available on any item we sell where the shipping charge is stated at under $3.50. The cost for this is $4 and applies to the ties and most of the small ornaments that we are selling.

    <Description>This is a fabulous shirt by The J.Peterman Company! It is new-with-tags. Peterman is originally known for their period clothing and fine quality clothing (expensive!). This shirt is perfect for SCA, period reenactments, or just someone who wants something stylishly different...my husband has several and wears them with his kilt or jeans. This shirt is a size XL for men. 100% cotton. It is white. Dimensions: length- 31 inches, sleeve length-26 inches, bust-29 front (58 around). CHECK MY OTHER AUCTIONS for other sizes and colors! Stylistically, this shirt is an upgraded poet or peasant style...It has somewhat full sleeves with gathers at the shoulder and sleeve. It has a banded collar and four buttons, buttoning to mid- torso... doesn't button all the way down. It has small pleats along either side of the buttons...This shirt looks SOOO nice on...The hem is flat so you can wear it untucked if you want. It is made to fit looser than your regular ole shirt. Buyer to pay $4.00 Priority USPS shipping. With insurance total would be $5.00. Get it now for christmas!</Description>

    <Description>PERRY ELLIS SUEDE LEATHER BROWN SHIRT ~ SIZE XXL ~ SEXY!!~ ~NEW WITH TAGS - RETAILS 130.00!!~ This auction is for a brand new with tags Perry Ellis Suede Leather jacket or shirt. Please note that this auction is for a size XXL even though the tag shows a medium, I have a few of these and just didn't think it was necessary to take a picture of every tag. It's light enough to be a nice dress shirt or heavy enough to be a dress coat or a wind breaker. The outside of the jacket/shirt is a brown suede and has 4 pockets on the front, two on the chest and two hand pockets. The inside is lined with brown silk. All tags are still on the shirt, including the extra buttons. This shirt is sexy enough for the Harley Davidson man, the cowboy or heck, anyone wanting to look good :-) The holidays are fast approaching, buy your guy this for Christmas or buy it for him to wear to your parents house for the holidays!! Ladies, these shirts look great on us too!! I accept PayPal, BillPoint, but prefer postal money orders. Postal money orders are cheap and easy and I ship immediately upon receiving them. I also accept checks (checks can take up to ten days to clear, and item will be shipped when check clears). Payment is expected within 15 days from the end of the auction or item will be relisted Please check out my other auctions, I have a couple of these shirts in different sizes and I am more than happy to combine items to save you $ on shipping. Please ask all questions before bidding as all sales are final. Buyer pays priority shipping and handling, and postal insurance is mandatory on all items that are breakable, buyer's option on all other items. I am more than happy to let you know what this would cost to ship to you, just email me your zip code :) THANKS FOR LOOKING AND GOOD LUCK!!</Description>

    <Description>This is a 10-pc lot containing seven sleepers and three onesies in the newborn (0-3 months) size. First, there are two white onesies and one white with pastel-colored polka dots. Next, there are seven light-weight sleepers. Brands vary from Carter's to Sears, etc. There are three terry-cloth sleepers, three lightweight cotton sleepers, and one slightly heavier terry sleeper (the one in very front of picture...like new!). All items are in very good used condition, with plenty of life left in them. These sleepers are great for newborns, even before the regular 0-3 month sized clothes start fitting well. All items come from a pet-free, smoke-free home. I accept Paypal (existing funds or bank transfers only), money order, or cashiers check. Buyer will pay actual shipping costs, determined by zip code and shipping preferences. (Handling charges will only apply if special packaging is required and extra supplies are needed.) Also, check out my additional auctions to save on shipping. Please feel free to contact me with any questions. Thank you for looking and have a great day! God bless!

    <Description>You are looking at the most fabulous light denim jean jacket which is 100% cotton for toddler girls from Baby Gap. The jacket is from Gap's lovely and large Valentine's Day collection which was in the stores in January, 2001 and this jacket was so popular that it literally flew off the racks! The jacket is a stunning light denim color - and is a great medium weight - perfect for 4 season wear! The jacket has a collar and snaps up the front with silver snaps. The stritching throughout is white and the neckline is lined in white and blue gingham fabric - SWEET! The jacket has two front pockets which close with snaps and a large heart embroidered on the back - WOW. This jacket is absolutely adorable and I have not found anything comparable in the past several years' collections! The jacket has a washed out effect to it! This jacket is the PERFECT match to a pair of heart embroidered denim jeans which I have just listed. Check out my other auctions, combine and save on shipping! Bid on this jacket and I promise you will not be disappointed, as jackets like this one is in stores at full price right now ($42.00 retail)! The size of the jacket is 4XL or 4 years(36 - 40lbs.), but it is quite a generous cut so they may fit a wider age and weight range. The quality of Gap is second-to-none and the jacket is thick and comfortable and are 100% cotton. This would be a fabulous addition to your child's Fall/Winter wardrobe! The jacket is in BRAND NEW condition, never washed and worn - still with their $42.00 price tag attached! Do not miss this opportunity. I live in a smoke/pet-free home so there are no smell/fur issues to deal with. Don't forget to check out my other auctions for some great tops/jeans to go with, combine and save on shipping!

    <Description>You are bidding on a group from Gymboree. Three pieces are from the cotton candy line and one is from the winter wonderland line. The cotton candy pieces include a turtle neck, sweatshirt, and leggings. The turtle neck and leggings are the popular cotton candy pattern and the sweatshirt matches them. It has three flowers on the front. Two are pink and the other has the pattern of the leggings and t-neck. They are all size large(4 to5 yrs). They are all in great condition. The other sweatshirt is from the winter wonderland line(I think). It is pink with a flower pattern embroidered on the front. There are two pockets and a zipper at the neck. It is size large like the others. I used the cotton candy leggings with this sweatshirt because the little dark pink flowers on the sweatshirt matched the dark pink flowers on the leggings. This sweatshirt is also in great condition. There are multiple outfit combinations with this awesome Gymboree lot. All of my items are from a non-smoking home. Buyer agrees to pay shipping of $4.45 for Priority Mail. We offer a discount of $0.50 to the buyer for payment by Money Order, or Cashiers Check only. Insurance is optional.

    <Description>Today I am listing 6 sweaters that I got from an Estate sale of a wealthy San Francisco Businessman. None of them appear to have been ever worn, but since I don_t know that I_m calling them like new. These sweaters are by Christian Dior, Munrospun, International INC Concepts, Lands End, The GAP, and Colours by Alexander Julian. You can_t go wrong here. If you like sweaters, or are bidding for your son, or someone else who like sweaters, be sure and check out all my other auctions. I ship at cost, combine shipping to save you shipping charges, and take paypal This is the last of my sweater sale today, but certainly not the least. It's a pale yellow size small, but it seems about the same as the mediums. It's 100% shetland wool and it too seems perfect to me. Another can't miss!!!!</Description>

    <Description>You are looking at a very nice outfit set by Gymboree. My daughter only wore this a few times, it still looks great. It is a 4 piece set. The jacket is light blue, trimmed in soft green. It is lined with the floral fabric found on the socks. Very nice snap up jacket and warm. I think size is 6-12 months but we took just the size tag off for comfort, Gymboree label still there. Although this outfit was worn by my daughter starting at 3 months and fit good. There is also a soft green long sleeve top 100% cotton with notched ends on neck and sleeves. The top is 3-6 months but looks big. The pants are a soft corduroy material, 80% cotton, 17% nylon, and 3% spandex. The pants are size 6-12 months. Very nice outfit. I accept paypal,money order, or personal check (10 day clearing). Priority shipping will be $4.00, USA. Check out my other Gymboree listings and I will ship together if high bidder on both. Please e-mail me with questions. Thank you and happy bidding.

    <Description>You'll be looking as good as gold when wearing this lovely gold satin evening shirt with button down front and pointy cuffs. Created from a lightweight satin, it is a dusky gold color rather than a bright gold and the cuffs can be worn turned back as well. There is a neck tie that comes with this that can be worn up around the collar if desired but I am showing it without the tie because I personally prefer that look. The tie can be completely removed if desired since it is not sewn to the shirt. This is created by Venezia and is tagged as a 18/20. Fabric is 100% polyester, machine washable. Shipping cost is $4.35 and measures as follows: Bust 53-54", waist/hip 54". There are side seam slits near the hip that allows for a bit more room there. Length from top of shoulder to hem 28". UNITED STATES BIDDERS ONLY PLEASE! *HOW DO YOU KNOW IF THIS WILL FIT YOU?* SEE DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO MEASURE FOR FIT FOUND AT BOTTOM OF PAGE AS WELL AS MEASUREMENTS GIVEN BELOW! All bidders are asked to read the terms of service listed HERE . (Please click on "HERE" to read them) Bidding implies that you have read all the terms and agree to abide by them. Misunderstandings can often be prevented by taking this simple step prior to placing your bid for any auction item. Combined auction wins shipped together to save on postage costs will be done only for auctions ending THE SAME DAY. I go to the post office and ship out in bulk once weekly, often twice weekly depending on volume. Please do not ask for SPECIAL DELIVERY as I cannot do time-sensitive shipping. After you pay for an auction, it will generally be shipped on the following post office day I have planned. In most cases where the outfit is sized too large for my mannequin excess fabric has been cinched behind the mannequin's back to simulate the proper fit of the garment. DO NOT GO BY THE PICTURES when thinking about fit issues, REFER TO THE MEASUREMENTS ONLY! See instructions at the bottom of this page for HOW TO DETERMINE FIT. I Accept Credit Card/Check Card Payments For My Auctions at the Following: SIZE INFORMATION...The return policy here at RHIANNON'S TREASURES is that all sales are final unless the item has been misrepresented, I am selling merchandise at well below retail in most cases (and often times even lower than clearance) and as such cannot absorb the cost of returned merchandise like department stores and high priced boutiques can do, so please familarize yourself with the correct method to use when determining a proper fit. The measurements I give you are with the garment laid flat and measured side to side, then I double that number to attain the total available room in the garment. The best way to compare is to take a garment that has a similar cut and/or style that you know fits you well and take those measurements with the garment lying on a flat surface (just as I am doing) and double that. BE SURE TO MEASURE THE BUST WAIST AND HIP AT THEIR ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM. Keep in mind that you need to be at least TWO inches smaller than the measurements I am giving in order to have a proper fit. All brand names are the sole property of their owners as well as all service marks, copyrights, and logos pictured or mentioned in the description. Their inclusion here does not in any way imply endorsement of these brands by their respective owners and are listed here as a fully independent sale. ALL AUCTION ITEMS ARE CAREFULLY STORED ON HANGERS IN A TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED 100% SMOKE FREE ENVIRONMENT. Each and every item I ship to you has been treated with the utmost of TLC, just the way I treat my own personal clothing, and will arrive on your doorstep carefully folded and smelling fresh and clean. I think one of the most delightful things about buying new clothing is that wonderful one-of-a-kind fresh crisp feel and aroma they have, and I want you to enjoy this as well so rest assured that your clothing has been carefully stored and handled and will never have noxious odors clinging to them when they arrive at your home. There are no smokers anywhere even near our property, so you won't have any unpleasant olfactory "surprises" when you open your package from RHIANNON'S TREASURES. Florida residents please include 6% sales tax.</Description>

Payment must be received within 10 days of auction's end. PLEASE DON_T BID IF YOU CAN_T PAY!! Please feel free to check my feedback. The one negative feedback that I have was filed on October 10, 2001 and was just a retaliation from someone I had to file as a non-paying bidder who was thrown off eBay shortly after for doing the same to a lot of other sellers. I stand behind everything I sell. If you are ever unsatisfied with any item you receive from me, please don_t hesitate to email me and I_ll make it right!

    <Description>This is a darling little 2pc dress set done in a stunning black and off-white houndstooth/gingham check pattern, a great "spectator" look. It includes a black mock-turtleneck style short-sleeve sweater which zips up the back and is separate from the dress so you can mix-n-match it with other items you own. The sleeves are slightly cuffed and on the center neck area there is an embroidered red heart to match the jumper's buttons. The jumper is in an adoreable gingham check/houndstooth-like pattern, deep scoop neck A-line style, and buttons up the back. There is solid black piping trim all the way around the bottom and some for detailing on the front of the dress. This style allows for a nice generous fit for long wearability. There are also little red heart buttons applied to the chest and faux pockets on the front for a "loving" touch! Wouldn't this be especially cute for Valentines Day?! But wear it now too, don't just save it for February! Made of a great medium weight fabric perfect for fall/winter weather and looks great with lightweight or thick tights and black patent shoes. My girls liked short sleeve sweaters because they always got too warm in Sunday school class--this is the perfect style. Unfortunately we moved to Hawaii before they really got a chance to wear this dress, it was maybe worn 1-2 times total so is in excellent condition. I also have a very similar dress in size 2T for the other sister/daughter in your family. My girls wore these on the same day and always reaped many compliments. Merry Christmas Bidders! I am glad you have chosen to bid on my quality items, a great way to save money on gifts this year and avoid the terrible traffic and weather conditions at the malls! You have my commitment for speedy mailing to ensure your item(s) reach you in plenty of time for Christmas giving, with prompt payment of course. Winning bidder is to contact me within 3 days via email. If I do not hear from you within 7 days, I will report it to ebay for non-contact/non-payment received. I accept money orders, cashiers checks, paypal, and Yahoo directPay. ABSOLUTELY NO PERSONAL CHECKS ARE ACCEPTED. Payment is due within 14 days of notification from me, including mail time_PLEASE do not wait to mail the payment until the 14th day, that is not prompt payment. Due to the latest restrictions implemented by Paypal you may pay with this service if you are using funds from your current positive balance, personal eCheck, or direct withdrawl from your checking account through Paypal's services. (They now prevent "non-business" accounts from receiving credit card payments- Paypal is preferred because I can ship your auction(s) immediately (remember Hawaii is now 5hrs behind Eastern time zone). You may also send well hidden cash (sent at your own risk of course) for payment. As a return courtesy to my buyers I ship immediately upon receipt of payment. Insurance is optional to all buyers but not required, however I cannot be responsible for your item once it leaves my hands to the post office. NO INTERNATIONAL BIDDERS--USA ONLY. All sales are final, so please read descriptions carefully and ask any questions BEFORE bidding. Shipping costs are to be determined by winner's zip code at the end of the auction. Items will be mailed via Priority Mail unless they are lightweight enough to go first class. I will gladly combine multiple wins to save you money on shipping.

    <Description>Georgia Satang 100% Merino Wool Pants Sophisticated blouse/shirt and bonus accessories! Classical elegance, this outfit can take you easily from meetings to dinner! The quality 100% Merino wool, fully lined pants are jet black, and appropriate for cold weather. They have an elegant cut, with 2 small (not exaggerated!) pleads on each side, straight cut leg (no cuff), front zipper closure, and diagonal pockets. The full lining is completely attached to the pants' hem (not just stitched here and there). In just-like-new condition, show no sign of wear, but just out of box so they might need a lint brush. Otherwise, perfect shape. They have a high end men's suit pants style cut. Very well made and elegant. The marked size is 12, but is a small 12 -- please check the measurements below: Waist: 28.5"-29" Length: 41" total - 29" inseam Leg width at bottom: 9.25" The blouse/shirt I am including in this auction, I have (gently) worn but is in very good shape as you can see from the look of the label in the closeup picture. No spots, holes, or any damage that I can see or find. I usually choose dry cleaning even where machine wash is allowed, and ALWAYS with shirts! Hate to iron! The only thing I can think of, is the first knot that acts as a button has been let out a bit to accommodate my fuller pregnant-woman breasts (sigh... where are they now??? lol) It is a feminine and not boring white shirt as I hope the pictures could show (both the pants and the shirt/blouse are very difficult to photograph due to the colors). It does not have a size label, but please check the measurements below. Shoulder to shoulder: 17" Bust: approx. 18.5" across (37" total) Sleeves: 21" Length: 20" I am throwing in the accessories shown in the pictures: a pair of black and white earrings and a faux pearl string but I usually wore with the blouse at the office. If you have any questions, I'll be glad and try to answer them. More boxes still to unpack here , more stuff still coming down from Manhattan! As I go through the stuff, with tears in my eyes and changing my mind 100 times, I must part with some of it that serve no purpose where I am now. So don't forget to check again my auctions in the coming weeks, for interesting (some REALLY interesting stuff) like (just a few examples): * GOLD LEATHER (LONG) EVENING GOWN * PURPLE BOA TRIM PANT SUIT * TIGRESS (TO DIE FOR!) SWING COAT/JACKET W/SKIRT * CRUISE FANCY GOTTEX BATHING SUIT * QUITE A FEW EVENING GOWNS AND CRUISE WARE DRESSES * INDIGO BLUE SUEDE FRINGED EVENING DRESS * LONG BLACK WINTER LEATHER COAT WITH FUR COLLAR * LIPSTICK RED SHEARED FUR COAT (maybe some other furs.. maybe lol) * POWDER BLUE LEATHER TALL BOOTS W/FRINGES * LEOPARD EXTRA!! TALL BOOTS and can't think just now... a lot more designer, boutique and unique items, a lot new some still with tags. Payment accepted: Paypal preferred (free to buyers, fast and easy!!) or MO/Cashier's checks Sorry -- no personal checks! My account is still in NYC and would be a pain to have to mail it to deposit it! Just as easy for you to pay with the electronic check through Paypal. Thanks! S/H $4.50 Continental US - anywhere else to be determined Includes delivery confirmation --Insurance extra (actual cost) If you enjoyed this listing, please look at my other items for sale!

I've used a very detailed,sterling, man in the moon face with a pave finish,(little rhinestones to make it sparkle!)with little Crystal dangles as the centerpiece. The necklace is all wireworked in sterling for durability ,using 3 sizes of the hottest new color of Swarovski Austrian crystal,Tanzanite, a rich periwinkle/violet. Please note the ends of my necklaces, I actually wirework the chain onto the closure, not just cut it and reclose it. Although that method saves time, it greatly compromises the strength of the necklace and I don't do it.The necklace can be worn up to 17 1/4inches or anywhere in between, simply by hooking up a link int he soldered chain.

On the left chest is a screen-printed graphic for Midori Margarita measuring 2_ x 3 __. This shirt was a promo item given away at a Midori sponsored event this summer. On the nape of the neck in back is another graphic, _Iggy_ measuring 1 __ x 2 __. I don_t know the significance of this. It might have something to do with Midori; it might be the brand of the shirt. The shirt is ADULT LARGE. It is washer/dryer safe. NOTE: If this is a holidy gift, I will do my best to ship it out within 12 hours of receiving payment. For fastest shipping pay online through PayPal or eBay Payments. You can find the links for them on this page. THIS NEW SHIRT WILL MAKE A GREAT GIFT FOR ANY PARTY GUY OR GIRL!

The hood of this jacket buttons on and off and has a double snap at the chin for keeping warm. The zipper on this coat zips right up so the fold down furry collar becomes the inside of a neck warming collar! There are three snaps on a the front of the jacket that snap a flap over the zipper to keep the weather out. The sleeves are gathered at the wrist also to keep the weather out but also keep the sleeves from falling down over hands trying to play! this coat is an excleent condition and washes better than any coat any of my girls have ever owned.

FORMS of PAYMENT: Checks or money orders are most welcome (10 day wait on some checks) and speedy packaging and mailing is guaranteed. Outside the U.S., please email for exact shipping costs and method of payment. Billpoint PayPal Overseas buyers can pay with Bidpay, international money order or check drawn on a US bank.

    <Description>The Royal Photographer I am not and my pictures rarely do justice to the nice items I have for sale. This is an awesome pair of Hiking Boots from the popular Adidas collection. Manufactured from a suede type material the image on the left is the closest to the real color, the other is in shadow. There are a couple of minor scuffs/marks on each boot and slight wear on the soles. Why pay all those $$ for new boots when this is how they will look when you have worn them a few times. They are labeled US mens size 12. Priority mail shipping will only be $6.45 to anywhere in the US. I have sold over 1,200 items on ebay to very satisfied customers. Please check my feedback and bid on this item with complete confidence. As always, this is a NO RESERVE auction with winning bidder to pay actual shipping costs. I accept money order, cashiers check, PayPal and BidPay payments. I ship by priority mail every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday at actual cost only. Good luck and thank you for viewing my auction.

Necklace is approx. 17" long and very dainty. This has never been worn - it was purchased from the inventory of a gift shop that went out of business in the late 80's. It comes to you in the original box. What a great gift this would make and it has a GREAT starting price. Price was marked $43.95 back in 1989 when the store went out of business. This item is very small and dainty. Would be suitable for a young girl. Buy it now!! I have eight other necklaces from the same shop at auction plus a pair of earrings.

    <Description>I bought both of these for one of my grandsons last fall. The brands are both Northwest Territory, and purchased at KidsRUs. They are marked 4T but shrank a size after laundering, so am selling them as a 3T. They have very, very little wear, nice bright colors, no stains or fading or rips. The sleeve length is 13", shoulder to shoulder width is 11" and length from collar to hem is 15". These look great by themselves or with a tee or turtle neck and little boy jeans. These are nice enough to wrap for a Christmas gift, are very soft medium weight 100% cotton flannel, and wash beautifully without any wrinkling. Come from a smoke and pet free environment, are fresly laundered and ready to wear.</Description>
