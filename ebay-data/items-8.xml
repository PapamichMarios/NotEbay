    <Description>While this critter has sat in my closet untouched for the past nine years, it seems as if the tape seals on the box were broken somewhere along the way. In looking in the box, I'm happy to say that everything is present, accounted for, and tie-wired down and plastic bag sealed.

So if some one finds that the staple are off, or some other flaw that only they see, the book are listed properly. You dealers in the buisness know what I mean, these collectors can see any flaw that no one else can find, except in the comics they are trying to sell. Thus I never list any comic as mint or near mint. / / combine with other items and save on shipping costs / Money orders shipped at once, checks must clear / if outside the states please remember that payment is in US funds. / Payment is due within 10 days of close of the auction. / SHIPPING &amp; HANDLING Priority Mail - normally 2-3 days $4.35 Book-Media Rate - normally 10 days - 2 weeks (although it has taken over a month at time, especially to Hawaii $2.75 If outside the states please inquire about shipping costs.

    <Description>Greek Classics Illustrated #1238 Heroine Of Epanastaseos is in very good/fine condition. This is a Greek history story that was not printed in any other country. We are now auctioning Greek Classics Illustrated comics that were published in the 1970_s. The Greek Classics had a different numbering system than the U.S. so I will identify the Classics with the U.S. Classics Illustrated numbers. Many of the Greek Classics have new painted covers that are very colorful and did not appear in the U.S. Some U.S. covers were redrawn or repainted so that the final cover is a little different from the U.S. cover. For some classics they had an artist redraw the U.S. inside art so that the finished art is a little different from the original U.S. art. The Greek Classics also printed most of the 80 new classics that were printed in Europe and not in the U.S. The Greek Classics Illustrated series also printed Greek history and mythology stories that did not appear in any other country. The Greek Classics Illustrated comics have the whitest pages of any classics comic printed in any country as they used a high quality white paper in printing their comics. Most Greek Classics have a price sticker on the bottom corner of the back cover. The overall quality is the best done by any country so if you decide to collect foreign classics then Greek Classics is the country to start with. Collecting foreign Classics Illustrated is a great hobby. Having your favorite classic in a foreign language is an excellent addition to your classics collection. The Greek Classics Illustrated is the most popular of the foreign classics in a foreign language since they are a little easier to obtain and have bright colorful covers. A collector has a good chance to complete a collection of Greek Classics while this is difficult to do with other foreign countries. All bids in U.S. funds. Shipping and handling for the U.S. and Canada is 3.50. All other countries can email me for the postage cost. If you win more than one comic or combine this comic with previous bids you have won then add 1.00 postage on each additional comic. Satisfaction is guaranteed or return for immediate refund. Payment can be by money order, cashier_s check, or personal check. We accept credit card payments by Billpoint or Paypal for instant payment. We also accept Bidpay.

    <Description>Vintage Sterling Fork Unusual Now this is a very unusual fork made in Mexico and comprised of sterling silver. It is very old from what the original owner tells me who traveled to Mexico in her younger days in the 20's and 30's. The markings on the back read 925 Mexico and there is an engraved horse I cannot make out what else it states. It measures almost 4 inches long The condition is great but it does need to be polished.

    <Description>This bank is really neat!! This Console style bank is by Think Way Toys (circa 1994), and is so much cooler than is looks in the picture. The blank, grey console lights up with characters from Next Generation, there are many voiced commands, and lots of lights flash! There are many sound affects from the show, as well. While this toy is in perfect working order, and very good condition, the box is pretty beat up. None the less, this would make a fine gift or addition to the serious Star Trek fan's collection. Winning bidder to pay $5.95 shipping USPS. I accept real money, checks or money orders ONLY. Thanks for your interest and good luck! See my other auctions for more great sci-fi items!

This is a lovely pair of hand embroidered standard pillow cases and two matching dresser scarves in white cotton. They have a large central heart in peach with a beautifully cross-stitched rose in three shades from peach to pink. There are also smaller flowers in lavender and blue which I would love to call violets but the leaves are too narrow.Each of the matching dresser scarves is 36" long by 15" and completely edged in lace. I've gone over every square inch of these and cannot find a single stain or any damage of any sort. Priority mail for this set will be just $3.95 plus insurance. I strongly prefer payment via PayPal.

    <Description>Corelle Callaway Ivy Tea Kettle and Storage Bowl Set New in the box is this tea kettle and 6-piece storage bowl set with lids in the ever-popular Corelle Callaway Ivy design. These are porcelain enamel on steel and are exceptionally durable. You'll receive a 2-qt. teakettle and the 6-piece bowl and lid set. Bowl sizes are .75 qt., 1 qt., and 1.5 qt. Each bowl has a plastic lid that fits snugly to keep air out and freshness in. Bowls will nest together for storage, but I display mine as they're pictured on the box.

    <Description>I bought this hand woven rug in Mexico about 15 years ago and my tastes have changed, so it was just stored in my linen closet for a long while. I have never actually used it as a rug, but it has been a wall hanging and a table runner. I believe the material is polyester/cotton (it is not all cotton). It is quite thick but not as thick as a hand woven wool rug would be. It is in great condition. It measures 24" x 45" and is in "earth tones", brown, cream, rust, black. Shipping within US is $4.50 for Priority Mail. Outside US is usually higher so please inquire before sending payment. Money Order/Check/Credit Card through PayPal or Billpoint.

    <Description>Apple Pie Shot Glass Product Description: This is a great glass for your collection. This is a clear shot glass with the design printed in red on both sides. Apple Pie Recipe 1 part Apple Schnapps 1 part Cinnamon Schnapps Garnish the glass with a slice of apple. Do you get to count this as one of your "five a day" servings of fruits and vegetables? Guess that would make it a "health drink"! Faux Facts (A story from the manufacturer): "Frank and George had been good friends for years when an old unresolved conflict led to a fist throwing fight between the two. George was left a broken jaw that required his mouth to be wired shut. Frank was left unscathed but feeling quilty. One day George had a craving for apple pie. Frank wanted to oblige. Short on ingredients and cash (since he was paying the medical bills), Frank decided to improvise. In the cabinet he found some Apple Schnapps and Cinnamon Schnapps. Since all George's food had to be blended so it could be consumed through a straw, Frank decided he wouldn't know the difference (especially after a couple of "slices"). Frank was right. George loved it and today, with a healed jaw, often prefers the liquid version over the baked one."

Black Mask is an adaptation of a Hong Kong comic book, with added touches of BLADE RUNNER and BATMAN. "Squad 701" is a team of professional killers who have undergone brain surgery and no longer feel pain or emotion. When it is discovered that some of these assassins are still capable of feeling, it is decided to "exterminate" the whole squad. Some do manage to escape in time, with one of them being "Black Mask" (Jet Li). He goes into hiding in Hong Kong and finds employment in a library under the false identity of Tsui Chik, and is soon befriended by a cop named Shek (Lau Ching-wan), known on the force for his cold attitude. Meanwhile, a group of assassins lead by one member of the late "Squad 701", is killing every major Hong Kong drug dealer in order to control the whole territory. Upon realizing that Shek is unsuccessful in stopping them, Tsui decides to again assume the identity of Black Mask, but this time in the name of justice. 2 CDs in one jewel case, brand new, sealed.

    <Description>Mark Pickvet combines his two previous volumes into one comprehensive guide, adding new information and creating a much simpler method of referencing the more than 4,000 shot glasses he has found. This third book in a series still employs the unique catalog number system, combining a three-letter code with a three-number code, and providing a quick reference guide for shot glass collectors of any degree. The book features large, detailed line drawings of more than 1,400 shot glasses, arranged alphabetically by catalog number in one continuous section. The catalog number below each glass gives clues as to the type of ware, geographical origin, and date of manufacture, while guiding the reader to additional information in the main description and pricing guide. A brief caption is also included directly below each shot glass for searching at-a-glance. The new encyclopedia features selected shot glasses shown in the first two books, plus an additional 1,000 new finds. Prefaced by a brief history of the international development of shot glasses, this book is user- friendly and collector-friendly with an emphasis on learning how to determine value. Pickvet educates the reader on approximating value in his general pricing guide. He also includes good and mint prices for each of the more than 4,000 shot glasses listed. This book is 336 pages and is a new and unused paperback. It is one among a number of books on collecting we have listed on eBay. To see current prices and pictures of all my auctions, click here. You will go to the crunruh Gallery. Shipping via Media Mail (book rate) is $3.50. We gladly combine shipments to save you money. International rates for international shipments. MasterCard/Visa accepted through Paypal, though C2IT is preferred. Earn $10 when you sign up and send money. See C2IT for details. Illinois residents please add 8.75% sales tax.

    <Description>I'm auctioning TWO PAIRS (total 4 panels) of pinch-pleat style, full length lined drapes in MINT MINT MINT Condition (no holes, no stains, no tears, from a smoke-free home)! These drapes have the prettiest country forest scene &amp; colors: A medium beige background, there are tiny cabins nestled among trees with lovely splashes of forest foliage! Colors include browns, white, yellow, orange, rust, black, olive green. I'm not sure of the fabric but they have a linen feel to them (these are VERY vintage--mom had them from the 1960s-1970s!!). They are heavy-duty lined for privacy and draft resistance (not fabric lined). Each panel measures 23"wide at the top(flares wider as they drop) x 82"long. VERY pretty and warm for a country home look, a vintage cozy look, cabin, ANYWHERE!!! US Buyer pays EITHER $8.00 shipping via Priority Mail OR we can ship via UPS or Regular Mail, rates for which are based on winning bidder's zip code. I accept PayPal, money orders or US personal checks (items ship after 10 day check clearance). **International shipping cost will differ from that quoted for US**.

    <Description>1962 Topps Mars Attacks #30 PSA 6!! Description Original "Mars Attacks" cards today are one of, if not the most sought-after non-sports cards issued over the last 50 years! In 1962 a sense of innocence among kids changed when Topps introduced its historic "Mars Attacks" 55 card set, featuring blood, giant insects and large headed aliens graphically illustrated using bright vivid colors, by legendary artist Norm Saunders! This card set was issued for only one year (1962) after numerous parental complaints helped cease production. Presented for auction is this 1962 Topps "Mars Attacks" card #30 and titled "Trapped!" The offered card has been conservatively graded and encapsulated by PSA (highly respected authentication &amp; grading service) in a EX-MT 6 holder. Displaying bright, bold, vivid color, with nice white borders &amp; corners, exhibiting fabulous eye appeal of this most treasured issue of the last half-century. A centering anomaly and factory mis-cuts, which are common to non-sports issues, with quality-control focused more in the sporting side of the industry, is apparently what prevented PSA from grading higher! Please look at our nearly complete set of Mars Attacks and other graded non-sports cards we are offering for auction this week. As with all our auctions there is No Reserve! We only ship USPS Priority mail or UPS, shipping and insurance are non-negotiable!

    <Description>I have 4 of these flasks, decanter, bottles and haven't figured out the proper name for them. This is really neat since it really took some work to encase this glass bottle in a fashion similar to the way the keg are made with wood fitted slats that are then banded to make them seal. This stands about 9" tall and almost 3 1/2" thick. It appears that different types of natural wood were used to make the encasement for this bottle. This one says "Navip" and Plum Brandy- Slivovitz on one side and on the other it looks like "Sapaakanta" , Ciapa Miszhbobnua". I am sure that isn't totally correct but for those who understand the language it should lead you in the proper understanding. It has a screw on cap which also says "Navip" on top. I must assume that at one time there was a wood cover for the cap but it is missing as is a small portion that surrounds the neck of the glass bottle inside. This bottle also has a inch wide multicolor strap that encircles the outer edge. This may be from Yugoslavia also since at least one of the 4 that I bought at the same household states that it was from there. Other than the wooden neck cover, there are no nicks or cracks and it still makes a nice decorator piece. Buyer pays 6.50 shipping. I do combine for shipping savings so please look at all of the others. Thank you.</Description>

    <Description>Forever People 5 VF/NM Kirby GIANT DC NR webpage Description: Incredibly undervalued 70's DC issue. Scarce 52 page DC with gorgeous Jack Kirby cover &amp; art ! Condition: Tough book in this shape. This copy has a very tight printer's stress crease on front and back cover...very tight and doesn't break the color (Not a reading crease, but where the paper bunched a little during the printing process) otherwise fantastic black cover book. Spine is stress free and corners are sharp. Light tan pages. No rips, tears or creases on cover and inside. No surprises on the inside pages. From what i've seen of the CGC this would grade in the VF-NM range. Picture tells the whole story. Value: With CGC's recent price increases, I don't think these are worth certifying unless they are capable of getting 9.4 or better so i'm offering a lot of very sharp items for a fair starting price. Bid with confidence... My books are all hand picked out of my collection. I am a strict grader. Look at my feedback... Cheap bid on a great book. All books are from my personal collection and were chosen for great eye appeal, regardless of technical grade. I have many other high quality items up for sale. Click this link................. to see my other stuff. Shipping Terms: Buyer to pay flat fee $2.00 regular mail shipping or $5.00 priority mail shipping &amp; handling.

    <Description>FLASH 209 (1971)--a 52-Page Giant in Very Good+ condition. This would rate a Fine or better if not for a mis-cut cover, where the spine is not centered. This is a common problem with these thicker comics from the 70s, and it makes the comic appear to have a rolled spine, even though it does not. The spine has some minimal wear and the cover shows little signs of aging. Otherwise, the book is flat and tight, with no visible creases or worn spots. The comic contains the Flash cover story, a Kid Flash story, and a Silver Age Flash reprint. See scan below for details. I'm starting out with a low minimum bid, and NO RESERVE! Buyer pays $4.00 for priority mail shipping. (International orders extra.) Shipping can be combined if you win any of my other auctions. PAYPAL, check, or money order accepted. If you pay by check, I will mail the comic once the check clears. Please e-mail me with any questions. Check out my other comic auctions!

    <Description>_ 1998 Swarovski Crystal Snowflake Ornament NIB _ _ _ This ornament is absolutely gorgeous - it is_faceted more than some others, so it really sparkles. It would look wonderful with your crystal ornament collection or make a great starter piece._ I believe they started the annual collection in 1990?_ I could be off a year or two. I have two of these 1998 ornaments for sale (bought one and received other as a gift)._ I will be using the same photos for the other auction_since they are equal in quality. I took many similar photos to show the cut and tried to show how it catches the light._ Swarovski's Austrian crystal is well know for its high quality and excellent craftsmanship._ They make wonderful Christmas gifts (I have given them as well as received them in the past)._ Even my father and husband think they are pretty._ If you want stunning Christmas ornaments - you can't beat these. I have never displayed this ornament. The box is_in great condition and the ornament is in mint condition._ Included is the ornament, the little Swarovski paper explaining it is an annual limited edition, the outer box, and the inner_box._ The outer box has a tiny bit of sticker residue on it, but looks good._ I would not hesitate to give it as a gift. I am selling my small, but beautiful collection of Swarovski Snowflake ornaments which consists of the following: 1993, 1996, 1997, and two 1998's._ _I am afraid to display them in my home since we do not have carpeting - if they fall they will break._ I received some as gifts and bought two for myself._ It seems a waste to keep them_but never display them._ I will be listing all of them_12/15 - so give me a little time to take good photos.

    <Description>This is a highly detailed prop I picked up ten years ago. It is made from hard ABS type plastic and is lightly textured. The side trim and interior parts are made from brushed aluminum. The lights are the small jewel type. The flip-up lid is of very high quality and the reason I purchased it in the first place; when you close it, the communicator has "that" sound we remember from the original series. The back and top appear to have been glued to the aluminum side trim, so you will have to take this apart if you want to add electronics. This appears to be similar to kits I've seen in other ebay listings, but I can't confirm the manufacturer. If you've ever wanted a high quality, solid feeling communicator, this is it. Reasonable reserve. Happy bidding! Happy bidding! Click on a picture to enlarge ') //-- ') //-- Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

This is a beautiful NM (Near Mint) copy. The cover is sharp and ultra glossy with deep colors. Both the cover and the centerfold are securely attached. The pages are supple and white. This issue has a full-length story featuring Cyborg vs. Two-Face. It is written by J. Michael Straczynski (Babylon 5, Rising Stars, Amazing Spider-Man). This could very well be Straczynski's first published work in comics. If so, this comic would undoubtedly skyrocket in both demand and value. As it stands right now, this comic is very much "under the radar" as many Straczynski fans do not know about it. This is a No Reserve auction, so first bid can win. Payment will be made with an international money order in US funds, or with a credit card (Visa/MC/Discover) through Billpoint. I also accept money orders through Bid Pay. Shipping will be $3.00 anywhere in the continental US, $1.50 in Canada, and more elsewhere. Bid with confidence, my feedback speaks for itself. Please check out my other auctions, and feel free to e-mail me with any questions. Win on multiple auctions and save on shipping costs.

    <Description>Nice, Star Wars Hallmark Ornament! Dated 1999, Hallmark Christmas Keepsake Ornament, Naboo Starfighter! Ornament is apx 6 inches long. An excellent, detailed replica of the sleek starfighter from Star Wars Episode I Phantom Menace! The colors are yellow and "silver". Young Anakin is in the cockpit and you can see little R2's head in the droid seat! From the story on the box: Long before the X-wing fighters faced the TIE fighters in the original Star Wars trilogy, Naboo starfighters were engaged in a fierce battle against the Trade Federation...Naboo pilots of Bravo Squadron were attempting a nearly impossible mission: get through the field of Trade Federation droid starfighters and immobilize the massive droid control ship. The ornament is in mint condition, wrapped in original bubble wrap. The box is in great shape, with little wear, with no rips, tears or smushes, but a slight indent on the back of the box. Ornament has original price of $18.95 on box. Wonderful collectible for the Star Wars fan! Even if this was your first Star Wars movie ~ or you remember opening day of the original! Nice piece! Buyer pays $3.50 priority postage. Please read my "about me" page for more shipping info! Take a look at my other auctions ~ will glady combine items to save postage!

    <Description>_ This is two VERY PRETTY Gold Framed Pictures. One is of Ballerinas. The other is of a Vase of Flowers. They are unusual. They have glass covering the frame. With another Gold trim holding the glass. Or like a frame inside a frame. The outside frame looks like it is made of wood but it is made of some kind of metal. The pictures are very pretty they have a very shiny look to them. Check out my other auctions. I have 2 other pictures up for auction like them. The Ballerina picture has a little hole in top of frame. I took a picture of this. You would not see this little hole when it is hung on the wall. The pictures are in good condition. The Ballerina picture is about 6 1/2 inches long by about 7 1/2 wide. The flower picture is about 7 1/2 inches long by about 6 1/2 inches wide. Buyer to pay $5.00 shipping and handling. Personal checks take up to 10 days to clear before shipping. Money orders the product will be shipped the next day. Insurance will be extra if requested. I always package the products well. But sometimes the post office can be a little ruff. If insurance is not requested, I am not held responsible for lost or damaged goods.
