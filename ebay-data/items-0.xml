    <Description>Scripophily Makes a Great Gift for Everyone Our Stocks are worth the paper they're printed on (sm) Our Company is a TRUSTED Buyer and Seller of Old Stock Certificates. Check out our About Me Page , where you can find out about us and read the recent articles about our company in Time Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, The Globe and Mail, Washington Post and our appearence on CNN. Beautifully engraved certificate from the Hertz Corporation issued in 1976-1977. This historic document was printed by the Security-Columbian Banknote Company and has an ornate border around it with a vignette of an allegorical man and woman sitting beside the company's logo. This item has the printed signatures of the company_s chairman (Robert L. Stone) and vice-president,finance and assistant secretary. This bond is over 34 years old. Hertz, the world's leading vehicle renting organization, is represented in over 140 countries, operating a fleet of 525,000 vehicles from approximately 6,500 locations. The pioneer of auto renting was Walter L. Jacobs who in September of 1918, at the age of 22, opened a car-rental operation in Chicago. Starting with a dozen Model T Fords, which he repaired and repainted himself, Jacobs expanded his operation to the point where, within five years, the business generated annual revenues of about $1 million. In 1923, Jacobs sold his car-rental concern to John Hertz, President of Yellow Cab and Yellow Truck and Coach Manufacturing Company. Jacobs continued as Hertz' top operating and administrative executive. This rental business, called Hertz Drive-Ur-Self System, was acquired in 1926 by General Motors Corporation when it bought Yellow Truck from John Hertz. The Hertz Corporation In 1953, the Hertz properties were bought from GMC by the Omnibus Corporation, which divested itself of its bus interest and concentrated solely on car and truck renting and leasing. A year later, a new name was taken -- The Hertz Corporation -- and it was listed for the first time on the New York Stock Exchange. Jacobs became Hertz' first President and served in that post until his retirement in 1960. He died in 1985 at the age of 88. In 1954, the new corporation bought Metropolitan Distributors, a pioneer in New York truck leasing dating back to World War I and the largest concern of its kind in any one city. In the process, the head of Metropolitan, Leon C. Greenbaum, became Vice Chairman of the Hertz Board of Directors; he later became Chairman, and in 1960, Chief Executive Officer. In 1967, The Hertz Corporation became a wholly owned subsidiary of RCA Corporation and operated as a separate entity, with its own management and Board of Directors. In 1985, Hertz joined UAL, Inc. On December 30, 1987, Hertz was sold to Park Ridge Corporation, a company formed by Ford Motor Company and Hertz management, for the purpose of purchasing Hertz. In 1988, Volvo North America Corporation joined Ford and Hertz management as an investor in Park Ridge Corporation. In 1993, Park Ridge Corporation was merged into The Hertz Corporation. In 1994, Ford purchased the outstanding shares of Hertz and Hertz became an independent, wholly owned subsidiary of The Ford Motor Company. On April 25, 1997, Hertz became a publicly traded company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol "HRZ." Hertz Today Hertz is headquartered in Park Ridge, New Jersey. Its current headquarters location opened in 1988. Prior to that the corporation was based in New York and, before that, Chicago. Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is the site of Hertz' Worldwide Reservations Center and Data Center, established in 1970, and its Financial Center, established in 1994. Car rentals, the largest and best known of Hertz' activities, are conducted from more than 1,600 domestic, corporate and licensee locations, and approximately 4,500 corporate and licensee locations outside the United States. Hertz offers a wide variety of current-model cars on a short-term rental basis -- daily, weekly or monthly -- at airports, in downtown and suburban business centers, and in residential areas and resort locales. Today, Hertz' Worldwide Reservations System handles approximately 40 million phone calls and delivers in total approximately 30 million reservations annually This Authentic certificate looks great framed and is much nicer in person than the scan indicates.

    <Description>I am selling a set of 6 coasters with different characters on them. One is a ballerina with a pink and red dress. Another is a bartender with a big mustache mixing a drink. There is a man in his green pajamas (I think) holding his head with stars swimming around his head (possibly a headache). Next is a couple of drunks sitting by a lamppost. And the last two are the same of a dancer with a top hat sitting on a stool with a drink in his hand. These appear to be for a bar. I'm not sure how the ballerina fits into the picture. There is one other coaster that came with the set that is being listed seperately. It is a black man playing a saxaphone. If you are interested in it be sure to look at my auction. But note it will end a day earlier than this group. Also there is a coaster with no character that I will throw in if the winning bidder wants it. They need to let me know. These coasters are really, really cute. They are in great shape with no chips or cracks. The colors are very bright and nothing missing. There are some brown spots here and there, but you have to have them in good light to see the spots. I really believe the winning bidder is going to love them! There is no reserve. The buyer will be responsible for shipping charges and insurance if requested. I need to hear from you within 3 days after auction ends. Payment must be received within 10 days. I accept money orders, cashier checks, or personal checks that will need to clear. Don't forget to check out the other coaster! Thanks for looking and good luck bidding. E-mail if you have questions.</Description>

Brand new, and mint in original box. The perfect item to show appreciation for a hard-working, little-thanked dad!! Sometimes a little token goes a long way toward showing a dad he's special, needed and loved. Corny? Probably. REAL? Definitely! In a society where "Cool Rules," REAL is the deal!! Bid now and let's get back to basics. NO Reserve, Low Opening Bid, Actual Priority Mail Shipping in the U.S., Actual AirMail to Europe and Canada. Usually NO RESERVE (unless otherwise noted), low opening bid, and Low Priced, Fast shipping. A quick word to our long time friends and customers as well as new: Other eBay dealers sell hose and other items, but not too many take the time to give you a good description and, perhaps, a little history, tips, etc...... We thank all of you who have taken the time to view, bid on and win our auctions! As always, we're happy to answer your questions about hosiery or any of our items. You can pay for this auction with: Money Order, Personal Check (will send you the item when it clears), With Your Visa Or MasterCard in the U.S. You Can Use PayPal. PayPal is now available around the world. Click on the PayPal logo below or visit them at: http://www.paypal.com, or, If You're An International Bidder, You Can Use Bid Pay To Send A Western Union Money Order In U.S. DOLLARS! They are at http://www.bidpay.com And now a quick word about our rules of the road. Please Take 2 Minutes To Read This And Avoid Delays Or Misunderstandings: 1.) Please Pay For Your Item Within 5 Days. If You're Having An Emergency Or A Problem, Let Us Know, We'll Work With You. Items not paid for in the specified time may be withheld from the non-paying bidder and may relisted. 2.) Non-paying Bidders Will Receive A Non-Paying Bidders Notice To eBay And Face Negative Feedback, And Ultimately Termination Of Their eBay Account If They Make A Habit Of Not Paying For Auctions. 3.) All Sales Final Unless Otherwise Marked So Please Ask Any Questions Before You Bid. 4.) If You Win More Than One Item Within 24 Hours, Please Be Sure To Let Us Know, So You Can Enjoy Combined Shipping And Save Money 5.) Please Include A Copy Of The Notification Letter With Your Payment For Fastest Service, Whether You Pay By PayPal Or Snail Mail. If You Don't Please Be Sure To Include The eBay Auction Number For Each Item, As Well As A Small Description Of Your Item(s) For The Fastest Service! 6.) Unlike A Majority Of Dealers On eBay We Leave You Feedback A.S.A.P. After Receiving Your Payment. We Would Appreciate Positive Feedback From You If You're Happy With Your Item When You Receive It. 7.) All Money Order or Check Payments MUST be drawn on a U.S. Bank, in U.S. Dollars. For example: A Money Order From The Royal Canadian Bank in U.S. Dollars is NOT accepted, not because we don't like Canadians, but because our bank imposes a hefty fee for such money orders. Canadian and European customers are encouraged to use PayPal or Bid Pay for payments. 8.) If you pay with PayPal and you have won multiple items, PLEASE make only 1 PayPal Payment and include all the auction numbers on the one payment. It simplifies it for you and for me. Also, PayPal charges a transaction fee for EACH payment made, in addition to their OTHER fees to the seller. We combine shipping to save you money - please combine multiple auction PayPal payments into ONE to help keep our costs low, so we can KEEP providing Lower Cost combined shipping.... A quick check of our feedback will show you that nearly every other buyer buys from us more than once!! Also, a larger percentage of our feedback centers on our FAST SHIPPING!!! Are you tired of paying for an item and waiting for 2 weeks? Not with Kathy's Nostalgiabilia. We get your money on Monday, and your item goes out by Wednesday or sooner if possible!! Our shipping rates are still among the best on eBay, even with the recent rise in rates in the Post Office. For up to 4 pairs of stockings: In the U.S $2.50; Canada: $2.75; Europe: $3.75. If you win other than hosiery items, Please See Listing For Actual Shipping Rate, or buyer is responsible for reasonable shipping rate. Believe me, ours are among the best shipping rates on eBay!! Our feedback profile is proof we deliver, however, we are not responsible for loss of goods in the mail that are not insured. Insurance is extra and based on total. Insured items go out once a week: Monday. Non-insured items go out a.s.a.p. upon receipt of payment. Kathy's Nostalgia Guarantees Every Item To Be As Described Or Your Money Back!

    <Description>This pretty talc tin is empty. It is from the California Perfume Co. 1997 Anniversary Keepsake line, named roses, roses. On the reverse of the tin is the story of David McConnell and how he started Avon. The tin is beginning to rust on the base and has some rust and scratches. This tin belonged to my sister for many years. I believe there is supposed to be a blue top to the tin, but it is gone. The top is rusting considerably, but it is still a pretty Avon memorabilia piece. Shipping and handling will be $2.20 for US sales. Please, no Paypal. Thanks for looking, and good luck!

    <Description>Here are 2 beautiful Christopher Radko-Trim A Tree- PINS. They both are the same and have Santa in his sleigh with a little elf helping him load up the sleigh with presents. There is a Christmas tree in the background. It has glitter on it to give it just enough sparkle to make this pin stand out. You're going to love wearing this pin!! It measures 2 1/2" long and 1 1/2" wide and has a pin back. They are new, not used. You get 2 of the pins shown in the picture for one price, what a deal!!

    <Description>Very solid comic, no missing or loose pages, no folded page corners, minimal handling evidence, colors good inside and out, slight age browning at the page extremes. Has pinup/poster back page. Buyer pays $1.95 for First Class shipping and handling to any destination in the USA and I will always combine multiple wins to get the best possible shipping rate. Insured shipping is optional but reasonable (starts at under a dollar and goes up depending on the value of the item, fragility of the item, etc.) I accept just about any kind of payment: All major credit cards are accepted directly and without fees: Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. I also accept Money Orders, Personal Checks, Business Checks, Cashier Checks and even straight Wampum. And of course, I honor basically all the payment services: Billpoint, PayPal, BidPay and PayDirect, with PayPal being perhaps the most convenient for both Buyer and Seller. My personal preference, though, is plain old checks and Money Orders. That may seem a little old fashioned, but online payment services are actually quite costly. Did you know that in most cases the Seller winds up paying PayPal and Billpoint more than the amount paid to eBay in Final Value Fees? Believe me, that's a fact. Online payment services are very convenient but they do drive up the costs for Sellers, so eventually this winds up costing all of us a little bit more. Please feel free to contact me directly via email at LindaGHTX@aol.com I Guarantee Total Satisfaction -- if you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason just return the item and I will refund all you've paid plus reimburse you for return shipping. Simple. I accept PayPal payments! Now Available for International Users Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>Letter to William Randolph Hearst at San Simeon, from someone signed "Maggie D." It appears the Mr. Hearst gave her a horse, but not the one she expected, and she is "upset"! It is dated, (1927). She sent him a photo of herself, with a haughty look and other "signs" that she is upset. This is a fascinating insight into a very mysterious man. I think this was probably from a family member, as he was dedicated to Marion davies at this time..(so I understand; he also was somewhat of a ladies man.) This is a unusual collectable. The picture is 8 1/4" by 10 1/4", and tinted. Will send in the U.S. for $5.00 Quote for abroad Click image to view larger version Click image to view larger version Click image to view larger version Low cost image hosting and full service auction management solutions: AuctionWatch</Description>

    <Description>Solid comic, no loose or missing pages, not marked, page corners not folded, colors good inside and out. Has a little edge wear on the spine binding edge, other 3 edges very good, has slight forward roll and light age browning at the page exteriors but overall quite sound and good. Buyer pays $1.95 for First Class shipping and handling to any destination in the USA and I will always combine multiple wins to get the best possible shipping rate. Insured shipping is optional but reasonable (starts at under a dollar and goes up depending on the value of the item, fragility of the item, etc.) I accept just about any kind of payment: All major credit cards are accepted directly and without fees: Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express. I also accept Money Orders, Personal Checks, Business Checks, Cashier Checks and even straight Wampum. And of course, I honor basically all the payment services: Billpoint, PayPal, BidPay and PayDirect, with PayPal being perhaps the most convenient for both Buyer and Seller. My personal preference, though, is plain old checks and Money Orders. That may seem a little old fashioned, but online payment services are actually quite costly. Did you know that in most cases the Seller winds up paying PayPal and Billpoint more than the amount paid to eBay in Final Value Fees? Believe me, that's a fact. Online payment services are very convenient but they do drive up the costs for Sellers, so eventually this winds up costing all of us a little bit more. Please feel free to contact me directly via email at LindaGHTX@aol.com I Guarantee Total Satisfaction -- if you are unhappy with your purchase for any reason just return the item and I will refund all you've paid plus reimburse you for return shipping. Simple. I accept PayPal payments! Now Available for International Users Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>TITLE: Star Wars: Tales of the Jedi-Dark Lords of the Sith ISSUES: #1-6 (The complete mini-series!!) WRITERS: Tom Veitch &amp; Kevin Anderson DESCRIPTION: This series was released by Dark Horse Comics in 1994. It revealed the bloody origin of the Sith and their eventual rise to power as an enemy of the Jedi. It's a well told story and should not be missed by any Star Wars fan. All the comics are individually bagged and boarded and range in condition from near mint to mint (the "fuzziness" seen in the photo is due to poor lighting and is NOT a defect on the comics themselves). SHIPPING/PAYMENT: They will be shipped through the Post Office with delivery confirmation which will be paid for by the buyer (cost will vary depending upon location of buyer). Insurance is available upon request, but will add to the shipping cost. Money orders, cashiers checks, Paypal and personal checks (buyer must wait 7-10 days for personal check to clear) will be accepted for payment.</Description>

    <Description>_THE FIRST NOEL_ You are bidding on a wonderful 3D MUSICAL SCULPTURE PLATE from the _HEAVENLY CHORUS_ collection by the Bradford Exchange and sculpture Roger Akers. Plate number 4944A is the fourth of this series. This sculpture plate captures a 3-D image of merry little angles singing &amp; playing musical instruments in this special Christmas collection. Not only is each plate in lifelike three-dimension, but each contains a music box that plays the beloved Christmas carol featured at the turn of a key. The detail is superb, and each plate has bright cheerful holiday colors. The texture and proportions of each object are perfectly captured from the original sculpture. This 5 plate series of charming hand-crafted art recalls the joys of Christmas. The plate is approximately 6 inches in diameter, is in mint condition, has never been displayed, and comes in the original packaging with certificate of authenticity. Each plate has a clasp on the back of the plate so that it can be hung on the wall and a small built in base so it can stand upright on its own. The plates originally sold for $44 directly from Bradford Exchange. This plate will make a great Christmas gift. I HAVE ALL FIVE PLATES FROM THIS SERIES AND WILL LIST THEM ALL. Winning bid can pay by BillPoint, PayPal, money order, or check. Please allow 5 days for personal checks to clear before I ship the item. PLEASE SUBMIT PAYMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS AFTER AUCTION HAS CLOSED. I pack the items carefully; however, I cannot be held responsible for lost or broken items. Buyer can purchase insurance for an extra $1.10 to $3.00 depending on the value of the shipment. Shipping is by Priority Mail. The plates are easily twice to three times the weight of a typical Bradford Exchange plate so shipping 1 plate is $6.45; 2 plates are $8.35 and 3 plates are $10.00. I try to give an accurate description of the condition so you know what you are purchasing. Please feel free to E-mail me prior to bidding if you have any questions. Will do my best to get the plates out as fast as possible, but shipping during the holidays can be slow. Thank you for looking. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER PLATES LISTED ABOVE NEXT TO Bigdawg85.</Description>

    <Description>INDEPENDENDENCE HALL Christmas in The City, or for your HISTORICAL LANDMARK SERIES COLLECTION!! Introduced in 1998 and RETIRED in 2000 this replica of Philadelphia's Independence Hall was the first Historical Landmark not associated with England. First available during the 1999 July event. This is a Set of 2 which includes Hall and Sign. This is a very wonderful piece and a must for any collector of Snow Village, Christmas in The City or just the Historical Landmark Series. In dependence Hall was the backdrop for the most important events of America's early history. It was there that the Declaration of Independence was signed on July 4, 1776. It was from its steeple that the Liberty Bell rang out to celebrate the first public reading of the declaration four days later. You will find this piece in MINT condition in the original box and sleeve. This item will be extra well packed for shipping. There won't be another INDEPENDENDENCE HALL and when this one disapears it will be into someones collection making it even harder to find. Just a reminder: when Dept56 retires its buildings, shops and accessories THE MOLD IS BROKEN so there is no chance of that building, shop or accessory ever showing up again in the future for sale in a retail outlet. 100% SATISFACTION GUARANTEED OR YOU CAN RETURN THE ITEM FOR A REPLACEMENT (if I have another) OR YOUR MONEY REFUNDED TO YOU IN FULL. PAYMENT &amp; SHIPPING: Buyer to pay $15.00 (this comes in a large box) which will include PRIORITY shipping and insurance in the amount of your final bid, plus a tracking number. I will accept PayPal, Billpoint, Money Orders, Cash and Cashiers Checks. (PayPal and Billpoint can accept your credit cards and Personal Checks, just click on the logo below for more information). If your are the high bidder on more than one of my auctions you can save on shipping costs. TERMS: Upon receipt of your payment shipment will be sent the following day. Payment must be received within 10 days of auctions' end or item will be relisted. Please email me with any questions and THANK YOU FOR LOOKING!!</Description>

Stone Print, Two Piece, Unused. Extraordinary Graphics! Close up of a small section This exceptional Robinson Crusoe poster was taken around by a "Front" man in advance of a traveling troop of actors who would go from town to town performing theatrical plays around the turn of the century. The Front man would write in with a crayon, or print on with a block printer, the time, place, and price details in the empty box at the top, then paste these to a wall or other appropriate place. Sometimes they went into frames in front of the Opera Houses or theaters that they were performing in. Predecessor to the movie poster! Phenomenal detail and coloring! Vivid colors, no fading! This has been rolled up in an old closet for over 80 years. The billboard poster is thick paper (not cardboard). It was rolled out on a sheet of wood and covered with transparent Storm Door window film. The reflection in the photos is from the transparent Storm Window Film that is stretched over the billboard.

Developed by the man who has had more influence than almost anyone else in magic on the Torn and Restored Card theme, J. C. Wagner, this is a practical and magical rendition of a classic card routine. Both the effect and the method are simple and direct! A card is selected and SIGNED along one edge. The card is then creased and torn into four VERY distinct pieces. Two of the pieces are put aside and the two remaining are visually and magically restored into one piece!! One of the remaining two pieces in now VISUALLY restored to the first two. The restorations are clean and beautiful to watch. With the last piece you get to see a J.C. presentation "Master Stroke" and why his creations are always tuned to the audience!! The last piece is placed with the first three and then handed to the spectator. The spectator holds the pieces for a moment and then opens the pieces to find a TOTALLY RESTORED SIGNED CARD !!

    <Description>ANRI Ferrandiz rare matched set BAKER COUPLE Click button to see more of my eBay items andale andalegallery -- andale andalegallery Here is a rare matched pair of ANRI woodcarvings, Juan Ferrandiz' "BAKER BOY" and "PASTRY GIRL". Only 1500 of each were created and only the first 100 sets were kept as matched pairs, making this set rather hard to find. Further, this set has never been opened; the box is still taped shut from ANRI. I'll be using photos from a previous set that I auctioned last year. Each piece is about 6 inches high, in 'new-from-the-Tyrolean Alps' condition; never displayed, never removed from their original box. The photos are from a previous auction of set Number 41. You are bidding on matched set Number 20. I accept Visa/MC via PayPal, Money Orders, Cashiers Checks and personal checks, although I reserve the right to delay shipment for personal checks, depending on your feedback. Usually I ship within 1 or 2 business days from receipt of payment. Buyer pays $5.20 for careful packing and Priority Mail plus insurance, if desired. I am happy to combine/reduce shipping costs for multiple items. Please email me with any questions. Connecticut residents only must add 6% sales tax. Click to...

    <Description>Up for auction is a PAIR of very Shabby Chic French metal shelves that hang on the wall. I am selling both together for one money. From the top of the ball to the bottom of the tassle is 32 inches. Each of the round shelves is 8 inches in diamiter. The tassles themselves are 4 inches long and the bows are 6 inches across. These are VERY HARD TO FIND and I am selling them with absolutely NO RESERVE. If you like the French Shabby Chic look you will NOT be disappointed with these. Please see my feedback profile and bid with confidence. These are heavy so the S/H/I to the 48 states will be $20.00. I will pack them well for the trip. I will ship internationally, but, any place other then the 48 states must pay the actual shipping. I am always happy to combine shipping so please check out my other auctions. I am always happy to put more stuff in the box as long as it will fit. I take credit cards with Pay Pal and cashiers checks for same day shipping and personal checks, but, personal checks may delay shipping. I will be unavailable from 12/10 to 12/14 and appreciate your patience. Thanks for looking and have fun bidding. Have a great day.

    <Description>Here is a cute whymsical little girl with kitten in a wheel barrow. Maybe she just found them in the barn? She stands about 3.5 inches tall. There is no tag on her but on the bottom of her base there is the marking of crossed sables and a wreath or a ring in the center of the two blades and the number of 1402 which leads me to believe that is may be from Enesco or Napco? The remains of a tag can be seen. If you know the tradmarks then you will be able to figure this one out. No breakage or crazing. she is in a matt finish. DO NOT USE CHECKOUT... We Do Not accept Checkout transactions. we Do Not accept eBay/Billpoint payments of any kind. We DO accept PayPal, Money Orders, cashier checks, Bidpay payments. WE will send winning bidder an email at auction's end with shipping/ins. fees...please reply directly to us. Please read auction for all details. We do not use checkout feature and will email you ourselves. return request will only be considered within 2 days from receipt and must be received by us in email. Shipping must be postmarked within 4 days after we have accepted the request. Return only upon item not being as described or damaged in transit. We insure all items through shipper so paperwork must be completed with help of buyer before refund for damage. Please contact us first. Please read all stipulations below, if you cannot honor or abide by them, do not waste our time or yours. We do not enjoy giving negatives or receiving threatening mail about an impending negative or non paying bidder process, but to be fair we have guidelines that we follow and make perfectly clear in our auctions. I really regret having to implement these stipulations in our auctions, but irresponsible bidders and timewasters have made it necessary. Those buyers who do not seem to understand that we do not take checks also have made this necessary. For those of you who are responsible bidders, who read the entire auction before they bid, please know that this is not aimed at you and that we welcome you and your purchase. I have met a lot of really nice courteous bidders and sellers here and hope to keep meeting you all in the future. For you repeat buyers, thank you for your trust in me and I really do value your business. 1. we use a set shipping and insurance fee . This fee will take in oversize boxes if this pertains to the auction, and delivery confirmation and insurance on all items. It does also include a handling fee in the amount which will take care of our expenses in getting the item to you safe and sound, extra insurance and sales tax. We try very hard to be as close to the shipping and insurance as we can,but still allow extra for the above. Shipping will be on the Saturday after payment is recieved. Shipping will be by Priority mail insurance , delivery confirmation and handling fee will mean a total shipping price of 6.50 for this item. non US bidders will need to pay more. Please contact us to make sure that we mail to your country before you bid and to check out the shipping and insurance costs. There are some countries that do not allow insurance and therefore we are not able to send to this country. 2. . I do reserve the right to not accept bids from those with negative feed-back ; history of non payment; late payments; lack of communications or unreasonable demands or retractions. If you snipe at the last minute, we will hold to these same standards and may not honor your bid for the same reasons. All bidders are held to the same standards to be fair. Regardless of feedback or buyer/seller status. 3. Payment is fine money order or cashier check. We are no longer taking checks. If you send a check, it will NOT be considered payment and will either be destroyed or returned with your merchandise upon proper payment. We also take paypal payments from verified accounts which unfortunately does not include other countries at present. You would send to momahedger@aol.com. 4. We do participate in the NPB process. 5. I leave feedback when I know that the buyer has recieved their item. I do not need for the buyer to leave it first, but I do need to know that the item has arrived. I rate my buyers on their payment, on their communication with us during and after the auction and their reading and following our guidelines in the auction. Many sellers do it different. As soon as I know that the item has arrived I will go and leave feedback . Ruby Lane Antiques &amp; Collectibles</Description>

MY WEB ADDRESS IS: CLASSICCOMICINVESTMENTS.COM PHONE(347)-672-3878FLASH #12 Please read this in full. MY NAME IS JOSEPH SERPICO. I belive the books and the free market speak for themselves (IN MOST CASES), so why thrust a imaginary support level on the auction? The cgc census report is now avalable on their web site, cgccomics.com (as of 7-12-01). I strongly encourage all serious bidders to visit this site, especially when bidding on more expensive or scarce books. Many of the books I offer up on ebay and on my website are of the highest slabbed grades at present, or in a good number of times-the ONLY book of it's kind to have been graded. This information is powerful when buying, selling or bidding. I am a CGC Charter member, and AACC member. My grading is guaranteed,-refering to unslabbed books, naturally- I have been a collector and seller/dealer for over 35 years. Many references available, if you need them. If not satisfied I will return a full refund for the books, as long as they are returned in original condition. All items packed securely. Shipping is $6 in the Cont.USA. Insurance is extra-$2 and up-(for merchadise $100 or more) depending on price of book, and I will not be responsible for uninsured books(anything over $100). I usually ship ONCE a week depending on volume, (sometimes more), using either USPS-priority mail, OR Fed Ex ground, either takes 2-4 days. All CGC books are non returnable, I will warrenty against any cracks in the slab, though. Most (USPS) books sent by certified. Overseas postage is at LEAST $15 per package, so please keep this in mind if you are bidding from overseas, or just please refrain from bidding. Also, most bidders are honorable, but do not bid if you are unsure that you can make payment and agree to terms. For USA orders, you may combine up to 5 CGC books and up to 12 non CGC books per order. Thanks for looking, have fun, and please visit my web site and other auctions. MY PHONE NUBER IS 347-672-3878, MY WEB SITE ADDRESS IS- CLASSICCOMICINVESTMENTS.COM Payment Options: I accept the following forms of payment: PayPal, Visa/Master Card, American Express, Money Order, Personal Check.

    <Description>This is a truly *vintage* old bottle, an atomizer that has a 4-ring metal neck and matching glass rings on the bottle itself. It is a two-mold piece, with a smooth bottom and what appears to be a "1" in a circle. The circle is definitely there, but if its a "1" or a "7" or exactly what, we're not sure. There is dried perfume inside, and the metal shows some wear, although its overall condition is very good. Definitely a late 19th, early 20th century atomizer.

    <Description>This 6 1/2" tall square decanter bottle came to me with the big mushroom shaped stopper, which increases it's height to just under 8". The bottle has beveled everything: vertical edges, shoulders, and sloping, beveled shoulder corners. It appears to be an early bottle, with a large pontil (equally large imperfection next to the pontil), tons of wear on the base, and a somewhat rough exterior (made that way). Large, inside bubble on the shoulder. Very small chip where the vertical edge meets the base. Ground mouth, to accomodate the ground stopper. By the way, the stopper has concentric rays on top, fairly fancy. The stopper is slightly hazy, with a tiny nick on the edge. Low opening bid of $5.00, and if you get it for that price, you've done well. The buyer pays $5.00 shipping, via Priority Mail. Insurance, if desired, is extra. Thanks and good luck.

    <Description>This early Avon item was produced in 1983. It is a Ceramic candle holder of a mouse cuddled up in an xmas stocking, next to a pot belly stove. The candle holder comes with a candle but as can be seen in the photos, heat has caused it to curve a bit and it received a scratch that has removed some of the red color. The candle holder itself is in excellent condition. While it has never been used, you will find some candle shaving in it as I pushed the candle in for the pictures. The box has been in storage for several years but as it was on the top, it is still in excellent condition with it's full gloss.. If you are interested in figural Avon Decanters/bottles be sure to look at the other items offered as I have several others up for bids. High bidder to pay shipping and insurance. If you decline the insurance, please understand that if the item gets lost or damaged during shipment, you accept that responsibility with no recourse for reimbursement. While I regret doing so, I must add $ .50 to help defray the increasing cost of bubblewrap. If you win multiple auctions, they will be combined to save you shipping cost. Pay Pal is available, otherwise, Money orders or Cashiers checks in U.S. funds please. Personal checks will be held for 10 days prior to shipping any items. Thank You. Check out my other auctions. For those of you that live up to your comitments, ignore the next statement. FOR THOSE WHO THINK THIS IS A GAME(AS TOO MANY HAVE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS), HEED THE FOLLOWING: IF YOU DO NOT INTEND TO COMPLETE THIS TRANSACTION-DO NOT BID. I AM GETTING TOO OLD TO DEAL WITH THE HASSLE FROM NON PAYING BIDDERS AND THEY CAN EXPECT NEGATIVE FEEDBACK.</Description>

    <Description>FN nice copy For larger scan than below, email: thinkbach@globetrotter.net Payment is by personal check or money order. You can also pay using credit cards with BillPoint or PayPal. Rates for surface shipping in the US or Canada are as follows: 1 comic.......$2.25 2 comics......$2.50 3 comics......$3.25 4-9 comics....$4.50 10-15 comics..$6.50 16-35 comics..$7.50 Larger........$9.50 up to $15 per large package For International orders please email for exact rates. Above rates apply to regular sized comics, Prestige format issues count for 3 regular comics. Multiple auctions may be combined. The good news is that shipping from Canada to the USA works great, but it is a tad slower than from within the US. Hopefully service and price can make up for the lag.

It measures approximately 10 1/2" across the top and 6" tall. This bowl is in remarkably good condition considering the age. It is marked 424 USA 10" on the bottom. There are no cracks on this bowl -- I do notice a couple of minor flea bites on the lower edge of the rim. There are several imperfections on this piece, which is typical for this kind of bowl. It adds to the charm. Overall, it is a lovely piece. High bidder pays actual shipping charge (based upon your zip code). Check my feedback and bid with confidence. Thanks for looking.

    <Description>Here is a classic open pontiled aqua medicine bottle. It is 5 1/8 inches tall and has 3 sunken panels. It is embossed: DAVIS arched in a recessed square on the front and VEGETABLE on left side and PAIN KILLER on the other side. Has a nice applied double collar and beveled edges. Similar to Greer's but this size not listed. Digger Odell states in his book, Pontil Medicine Encyclopedia, that Perry Davis was a carpenter and discovered this formula and began selling this medicine in a basket-What a change in occupations. Digger does not list this size either. This medicine was also referred to in the classic novel of Tom Sawyer. The condition is good-it is dug with a nice haze. No chips, dings or cracks in the glass. The glass is crude and has wonderful whittle. The base is the real odd feature-has a horseshoe type key mold, an x on each side with a nice open pontil in the center. Would make a nice addition to any Early pre-civil war or Pontiled Medicine bottle collection. No reserve. Thank you for looking at this item and God Bless.

    <Description>This charming, porcelain cross depicts a bride and groom kneeling before a minister on their wedding day. The caption _Heaven Bless you_ is written underneath. This would make a great wedding present or Christmas present for that Precious Moments Collector. It can be mounted on the wall since it includes a nail hole on the backside. This is in the original box and was purchased as a SLIGHTLY flawed piece (the flaw being a few detail painting trails that are not too noticeable). Copyright 1991, #235563 I accept Ebay and Paypal payments. If payment is not received within 3 days of Auction closing, item will be re-listed. Buyer to pay actual shipping costs. Send me your zip code and I will be glad to calculate shipping. Thanks for looking and bidding! *All sales are final*</Description>

    <Description>This period adventure, told in the breakneck fashion of the old serials, is one of the most acclaimed comics of all time. Set in 1938, it's about a stunt pilot for an air-circus who comes across a rocket-pack, keeps it to impress his girlfriend with, and ends up falling afoul of government agents, Nazis, and the device's inventor, a certain famous pulp hero. A must-read. Condition is F/VF; a bit scuffed, but flat, with no major dings or creases. Winner agrees to pay shipping. Money orders/cashier's checks shipped lickety-split. Personal checks must clear. Note to international bidders and those wishing to pay by credit card: I am registered with BidPay. Check out my other auctions; I'm cleaning out the apartment and unloading lots of books, movies, games, collectibles, and whatnot. I'll be happy to combine multiple auction winnings to save shipping.

What if Luke had missed his "one-in-a-million" shot that destoyed the first Death Star? This story is fun to read. As you can guess these books are becoming very hard to find.

    <Description>NR Hallmark SILVER STAR Train Set of 3 mimb I recently attended an auction of a huge number of collectibles a local woman had bought. She had purchased such a huge quantity of decorative items that most were stored away in a storage unit and never displayed. Among her collections were many Hallmark ornaments, which had never been out of the boxes. This is one of those. This is a set of 3 metal train cars -- a locomotive, luggage car, and dome car. It is from 1992 and is #QX532-4. These are very nicely made. This set hasn't been out of the box and is in like new condition. The box is in good condition (a few scuffs) and bears the original $28 price tag. SPECIAL HOLIDAY MAILING NOTE: We normally ship within 24 hours of receiving payment. Please be aware that we have no control over the delivery time after packages leave our hands. We can guarantee our shipping time but cannot guarantee delivery by a particular date. I accept checks, money orders, Billpoint, and Paypal for US sales and Billpoint, Paypal, Bidpay, and international POSTAL money orders for international sales. US shipping will be $4.25 plus the cost of insurance, if desired. I offer either insured or uninsured shipping on many items. I wrap very carefully but cannot assume responsibility for safe delivery without insurance. I have specialized in the sale of Estate Fine Jewlery for many years. My huge collection of pieces from the late 1800s to the 1970s has been very popular at shows and my shop, and I have just started listing a few pieces of well-priced, quality vintage gold and gemstone jewelry on ebay.

He comes complete with the original box with its protective interior and he does have his staff. The figure is in fine condition; however, his right thumb appears to be shorter than the left thumb.

    <Description>This is a nice vintage set made to depict a tall ship with many sails named REVENGE from 1688. They are each made from a cast metal that was made to look like bronze on one side and gold or brass on the face. The name of the ship and the year it was commissioned are on both. The opener is 5" long and the stopper is almost 5" long. They are in very good condition and both have a ring at the top for hanging. Buyer pays $3.50 priority postage, insurance or international will be more. Expect prompt mailing with the use of paypal or money order, checks will be held for clearing. Thanks for looking and good luck!</Description>

    <Description>Here is a pair of Christmas Bears that measure 3 1/2" high. They are in a sitting position and one has a present between his legs and the other has a tree. On the bottom of these two is the Homco black and gold sticker and the number 5505. They were introduced into the Home Interior line in the late 1980's or early 1900's, and have since been retired. Would work real nice for your Christmas decorating this year with no chips, cracks, or breaks. Buyer pays shipping and insurance. Will accept checks, will have to clear, or money orders.

Ritzenhoff revives this tradition and has commissioned the best designers to restore beer to its true dignity. They have given beer a truly royal face, and now provided beer drinkers with a colorful greeting for their tipple: cheers! Make a great accent piece. Will surely catch the eye of your visitors.
