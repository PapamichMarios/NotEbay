    <Description>Welcome to eBoro Welcome to _ e B o r o ! _ THE MARTIAN CHRONICLES a $40.00 RETAIL VALUE ! You are bidding on: The original vhs tapes The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury, starring Rock Hudson, Roddy McDowall, Darren McGavin, Bernadette Peters! Vol. 1 - The Expedition Vol. 2 - The Settlers Vol. 3 - The Martians. They play GREAT! They come in BRAND NEW clamshell cases (original cases cut to fit these new cases). Some sun fading. Earth sends its first manned probe to Mars in 1999, and a jealous Martian murders the two astronauts when his wife has erotic dreams of meeting them. Members of a subsequent expedition are hypnotized into believing that they have landed in the childhood community of their leader and have been reunited with deceased family and friends, and they are poisoned by the Martians. Col. John Wilder leads a third expedition and learns that a chicken pox virus brought to Mars by the first two expeditions has almost eradicated the Martian population. A member of Wilder's team becomes obsessed with protecting Mars from Earthman and murders some of the others in Wilder's party, before Wilder kills him. Colonists arrive on Mars to settle, among them priests seeking God, and a lone Martian masquerades as the most desired persons of various settlers. Global war on Earth reduces man's natal planet to radioactive waste, and most of the settlers returned there prior to the holocaust. Wilder struggles to assemble the remaining humans on Mars, who cope with their loneliness in different ways and will not leave their piece of Mars, before Wilder meets a Martian of past or future who tells him the secret of simple Martian life and convinces him to abandon the Earth lifestyle.

    <Description>******ALL PHOTOS TOP QUALITY MINT 8X10_S.****** Hi everyone, my name is Jerry and I am going to be helping my friend Amy over at EBAY POWERSELLER CELEBSIGN this week. We created this account 2nd account to sell strictly Preprints to help ourselves stay more organized. Business is booming during this holiday season and she runs up to 400 items per week and by splitting up the items we will be better able to serve you. You will receive your items quicker by allowing me to split the work of processing orders among my partners. Theses Preprints are among the best quality I have ever seen and are exact replicas of the original Hand Signed Versions that I have in my display cases covering the walls of my home and office space. Many of these original photos are worth over $100.00 and here you can have an exact replica for a fraction of the cost. I promise 99.9% of the people who receive these photos have a very very very hard time telling the difference from the original hand signed one. These things are so damn good that even I can barely tell the difference from the originals when they are both in my hand, and when they are hanging onm the wall in a picture frame it is virtually impossible. These replicas are wonderful for bars, restaurants, club houses, ect where theft is a possibility. Customers will think they are real and it one gets stolen or damaged it not like your out hundreds of dollars. Shipping is $2.00 no matter how many you buy!!! $5.00 outside USA. I CAN ONLY TAKE MONEY ORDERS, CASH, OR PAYPALL FOR THIS ACCOUNT, NO CHECKS!!!!!</Description>

    <Description>DVD - Jurassic Park III Widescreen Edition Surpassing expectations to qualify as an above-average sequel, Jurassic Park III is nothing more or less than a satisfying popcorn adventure. A little cheesier than the first two Jurassic blockbusters, it's a big B movie with big B-list stars (including Laura Dern, briefly reprising her Jurassic Park role), and eight years of advancing computer-generated-image technology give it a sharp edge over its predecessors. While adopting the jungle spirit of King Kong, the movie refines Michael Crichton's original premise, and its dinosaurs are even more realistic, their behavior more detailed, and their variety--including flying pteranodons and a new villain, the spinosaurus--more dazzling and threatening than ever. These advancements justify the sequel, and its contrived plot is just clever enough to span 90 minutes without wearing out its welcome. Posing as wealthy tourists, an adventurous couple (William H. Macy, T_a Leoni) convince paleontologist Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and his prot_g_ (Allesandro Nivola) to act as tour guides on a flyover trip to Isla Sorna, the ill-fated "Site B" where all hell broke loose in The Lost World: Jurassic Park. In truth, they're on a search-and-rescue mission to find their missing son (Trevor Morgan), and their plane crash is just the first of several enjoyably suspenseful sequences. Director Joe Johnston (October Sky) embraces the formulaic plot as a series of atmospheric set pieces, placing new and familiar dinosaurs in misty rainforests, fiery lakes, and mysterious valleys, turning JP3 into a thrill ride with impressive highlights (including a T. rex versus spinosaurus smack-down), adequate doses of wry humor (from the cowriters of Election), and an upbeat ending that's corny but appropriate, proving that the symptoms of sequelitis needn't be fatal. *DTS Surround Sound, Dolby Digital *PAL Formatted (not NTSC) *Subtitles: English, Malay, Chinese &amp; Thai WInner please add $4.50 S&amp;H. Personal checks, money order &amp; paypal are accepted. Good Luck!!!</Description>

    <Description>FRANK CAPRA'S PRELUDE TO WAR - SPECIAL COLLECTOR'S EDITION. The dvd is new &amp; is factory sealed. Special features include interactive menus, scene index, and quiz. PRELUDE TO WAR was the first entry in the U.S. WAR DEPARTMENT'S WHY WE FIGHT series, a group of seven moral-boosting documentaries supervised by Lt. Col. Frank Capra. As brilliantly assembled as any of Capra's "populist" Hollywood films, PRELUDE demonstrates how the diplomatic and political blunders made in the wake of WWI led inexorably to World War II. Especially culpable are those complacent citizens of the USA who were led to believe that the problems of the rest of the world had no bearing on their lives. While America sleeps, Japan and Germany slowly and methodically build their armies and launch their plans for global conquest. Throughout the film, the lies of fascisim and totalitarinism are contrasted with the ideals of Democracy. Unlike most other War Department efforts, the 53 minute WHY WE FIGHT was shown to both civilian military audiences. U.S. shipping and handling is $3.00. International shipping is $4.50. Paypal, Bidpay, U.S. checks, cash and money orders are accepted for payment.</Description>

Please contact us and let us know what you would like to see listed on eBay. Thanks for stopping by and good luck! Bid efficiently with Proxy Bidding _ here's how it works: _ Your maximum bid is kept secret , and it's not necessarily what you'll pay . eBay will bid on your behalf (which is called proxy bidding) by steadily increasing your bid by small increments until your maximum is reached . _ Why? Because it means you don't have to monitor the auction as it unfolds. You also don't have to worry about being outbid at the very last minute unless someone bids over your maximum dollar amount. Want more details? Check out an example of proxy bidding . _ Choose your maximum carefully , though, as you won't be able to reduce it later. Your bid is a contract _ Only place a bid if you're serious about buying the item; if you're the winning bidder, you will enter into a legally binding contract to purchase the item from the seller.</Description>

    <Description>Cool RETURN OF THE JEDI Spec Ed Movie Poster Click picture to enlarge Click picture to enlarge Click picture to enlarge Description RETURN OF THE JEDI THE AWESOME US SPECIAL EDITION ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER OF THE CLASSIC GEORGE LUCAS MOVIE!!! YOU ARE BIDDING ON THIS AWESOME MOVIE POSTER WHICH IS THE US REGULAR ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER AND IS IN MINT CONDITION, NEVER USED WITH SHARP EDGES AND CORNERS AND COMES ROLLED, PROTECTIVELY WRAPPED IN PLASTIC, CUSHIONED AND SECURED AND SHIPPED IN A PROTECTIVE TUBE (WE HAVE OVER 10 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE MAIL-ORDER BUSINESS SO BID WITH CONFIDENCE!!!). POSTER INFORMATION: THIS IS THE US ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER. IT MEASURES 27x40 (APPROX) AND IS AN ORIGINAL STUDIO RE-ISSUED MOVIE POSTER (NOT A POSTER-HOUSE REPRINT!!!). When the studios started to realize there was a mass market for their movie posters, they have gone back and re-issued several of them. This poster is one of them. It is identical to the first printing done by the studio. Only an appraiser could probably tell the difference. Now, as far as collectability goes, to give you an example - First printings for RETURN OF THE JEDI posters sell for about $100 each (if you can even find one). The studio realized that this was not appropriate for the average person who wanted the poster for their wall and so they went back and re-issued the poster in mass quantity and so the value of the re-issues is not like the first printings, yet you get basically the same quality.

    <Description>The Complete Best of the Muppet Show Collection - 10 Volume Set _ This auction is for the complete Best of the Muppet Show collection, which is a 10 volume DVD set, with each volume containing 3 full-length, hilarious episodes filled with great music, big stars, and the lovable Muppets. This set is hard to find and is not available in stores. Each episode is uncut with never before released footage. The DVDs are all brand new and factory sealed. The following is a list of all the DVDs, the guest stars that appear in each episode, and a short description of what happens. Click on the link to view the entire DVD cover. DVD 1 Elton John - The pop superstar takes center stage with outrageous costumes and some of his greatest hits, including "Crocodile Rock" and "don't Go Breaking My Heart." Julie Andrews - The beloved musical star yodels the tale of a lonely goat herd, serenades Kermit, and whistles a happy tune in the company of giant monsters. Gene Kelly - The legendary musical-comedy star gives Kermit a dance lesson, performs a romantic duet with Miss Piggy, and sings a medley of tunes from his classic movies._ DVD 2 Mark Hamill - Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and R2-D2 hijack the crew from Pigs in Space to rescue Chewbacca, then join in a big "star" tunes finale in a galaxy far away. Paul Simon - The popular singer-songwriter runs afoul of the law while performing "Scarborough Fair" with Miss Piggy and joins the Muppet band for a rollicking "Loves Me Like a Rock." Raquel Welch - The international sex symbol goes prehistoric to sing and dance with a giant spider and teams with Miss Piggy for a show-stopping "I Am Woman" (W-O...P-I-G!)."_ DVD 3 Harry Belafonte - The calypso legend performs his classic hit "Day-O", tries to out-drum Animal, and joins a chorus of African-masked chanters for his uplifting "Turn the World Around." Linda Ronstadt - The pop star battles Miss Piggy for Kermit's affections, in between performing some of her smash hits - including "Blue Bayou" and When I Grow Too Old to Dream." John Denver - John organizes a camping trip, watches his garden grow "Inch by Inch", gives Gonzo some helpful advice, and joins the cast in "Grandma's Feather Bed."_ DVD 4 Peter Sellers - The chameleon-like actor turns into a demented gypsy violinist, plays a very strange doctor on "Veterinarians' Hospital", and joins a temperance band. John Cleese - The Monty Python funnyman portrays a bufuddled pirate bent on capturing the cast of Pigs in Space, helps Gonzo shape up, and reluctantly sings "The Impossible Dream." Dudley Moore - The comic star of Arthur demonstrates his "music and good management apparatus" - to the dismay of the cast - and brings down the house with the Muppet jazz band._ DVD 5 Alice Cooper - It's a devilishly good time when the rock star performs a haunting "Welcome to My Nightmare", goes recruiting for wayward souls, and declares "School's Out Forever." Vincent Price - The prince of horror meets up with Gonzo and Rowlf in a spooky old house, gives Kermit vampire lessons, and serenades some of his favorite monsters. Marty Feldman - The bug-eyed comedian plays the beautiful storyteller Scheherazade, a genie, and a flying carpet inventor in a spectacular Muppet version of the Arabian Nights._ DVD 6 Steve Martin - The wild-and-crazy comic creates some really twisted balloon animals, becomes a banjo-pickin' "Rambling Guy", and joins the Muppet Jug Band for a foot-stomping bluegrass finale. Carol Burnett - The queen of comedy does some light cleaning, sings a romantic polka, demonstrates why she "was Made for Dancing", and performs her "Lonely Asparagus" sketch. Gilda Radner - The Saturday Night Live star duets with a giant carrot, gets caught in a sticky situation at Muppet Labs, and becomes very attached to the cast while she taps her troubles away._ DVD 7 George Burns - Gonzo fiddles while George Burns outwits a tabloid reporter, croons classic tunes from vaudeville days, and - backed by harmonizing Muppets - serenades Miss Piggy. Dom Deluise - The funnyman encounters some very unfriendly aliens, swaps insults with Miss Piggy, and demonstrates the wrong way to care for rambunctious monsters. Bob Hope - The popular entertainer becomes a human cannonball, trades quips with Kermit, and rides the range on a singing horse for a duet of "Don't Fence Me In."_ DVD 8 Diana Ross - The divine diva of soul helps Kermit win over a tough crowd, shows Fozzie how to sell a joke, and performs "Love Hangover" and "Reach Out and Touch." Brooke Shields - Things get more and more curious for Brooke, who grows up a little to fast, attends a mad tea party and nearly looses her head in a Muppet version of Alice in Wonderland. Rudolph Nureyev - The ballet superstar dances an unforgettable "Swine Lake", joins Miss Piggy for a steamy duet, and puts on his top hat and tails for a big Broadway-style finale._ DVD 9 James Coburn - The famous tough guy helps Animal channel aggression, goes gangbusters in a Roaring '20s speakeasy, and sees his calming "Eastern" turn into a rowdy Western. Sylvester Stallone - The star of Rocky meets his match as a singing gladiator, shows his fans how to throw a punch, and warbles the sad tale of "A Bird in a Gilded Cage." Debbie Harry - The rock star becomes an honorary frog scout, reflects on rainbows with Kermit, and sings her group Blondie's hits "One Way or Another" and "Call Me."_ DVD 10 Roger Moore - It's an evening of spies and suspense, as the suave 007 star narrowly escapes "bonding" with Miss Piggy, then battles a team of cute, cuddly, and deadly enemy agents. Edger Bergen - See Muppets versus puppets when the legendary ventriloquist, Charlie McCarthy and Kermit discuss frogs and logs, and Fozzie gets advice from Mortimer Snerd. Danny Kaye - The multi-talented entertainer knocks himself out getting ready, then dances "cheek to cheek" with Miss Piggy, gives Swedish Chef a cooking lesson, and sings "Inchworm."_ Shipping in the US will be $7.50 by USPO Priority Mail.

    <Description>Hey Steve Martin / Rick Moranis Fans! This is a Japanese movie program for LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS . It measures 8.5" by 11", is printed on HEAVY STOCK paper and is CHOCK FULL OF BEAUTIFUL COLOR PICS! Please see the scans below for an idea. When movies are released theatrically in Japan, souvenir programs are sold at the theater. The programs are like magazines which feature color pictures as well as b&amp;w photos, and lots of accompanying text (mostly in Japanese). What makes these programs so unique is that they feature a lot of pics (from the film as well as publicity shots) that aren't commonly available. Movie programs are a big collectible in Japan, and for good reason: they're QUALITY mementos of your favorite films. They go for big bucks over there, but there is NO RESERVE on this auction! Please see our other auctions for more programs of classic films. Winners of multiple program auctions save a ton on shipping (just one shipping charge) and receive a 5% discount off their entire order! Please take note of our feedback: We pride ourselves on service! We ship 5 days a week and try to make all transactions speedy! Direct shipping from the USA! We accept payment by check or money order. Payment must be received within 10 days of the end of the auction. Personal checks take 10 days to clear, money orders and bank checks are processed ASAP. Winner pays $4.00 for shipping within the US. International shipping will cost more. CA residents please add 8% sales tax. Please e-mail with any questions (deelu@hotmail.com). Please wait for all the pictures to load, you won't regret it. Thanks for looking and thanks for bidding! NOTE: Please don't bid if you have multiple negative feedback. Also, if you have zero feedback, please e-mail us first before bidding. Due to the high number of flakey bidders, we reserve the right to cancel any bids we deem to be risky.

    <Description>The Glass Bottom Boat is hardly a high point in the careers of star Doris Day and director Frank Tashlin, though it is a better-than-usual example of that pure-1960s genre, the "spy spoof." Day plays Jennifer Nelson, a PR worker at NASA in Florida. She also doubles as a "mermaid" for her father Axel (Arthur Godfrey), the skipper of a glass-bottom tourist boat. While garbed in her skimpy mermaid costume, she has a run-in with handsome space technician Bruce Templeton (Rod Taylor). Through a series of misunderstandings, Bruce is led to believe that Jennifer is an enemy spy, determined to steal scientific secrets. Several other characters enter into the plot, including bumbling secret agent Julius Pritter (Dom DeLuise) and prissy security chief Homer Cripps (Paul Lynde). Also on hand are TV favorites Dick Martin as Jennifer's erstwhile beau and Eric Fleming as a man of mystery. A few cute celebrity cameos round out this ribtickler, while Doris Day, as always, gets a few opportunities to sing. DELUXE LETTER-BOX EDITION. Color/1 hour 50 minutes. Contains the Featurette AT NASA. DISC IN EXCELLENT CONDITION. Aside from some moderate scuffing on top spine and the number 35 written in black ink on back, upper-right corner, Jacket is in near Excellent condition. NO RESERVE. PAY PAL ACCEPTED. Buyer pays $5 priority shipping (I use bubble wrap and appropriate boxes). Win more than one of my auctions - add only $1.50 for each single additional LD and $2.00 for each box set shipped in the U.S.! International bids welcome - higher shipping rates apply. MO's go right out - checks OK - please just write a valid one. ATTENTION: ALL MY AUCTIONS, INCLUDING THIS ONE, ARE LASERDISCS - NOT VHS TAPES, CD'S OR DVD'S!!! If you win a LD thinking it was a VHS or other because you failed to read the full description, you MUST follow through with payment. DVD's are coming out on many titles, but don't assume all films on laser will come out on DVD - they may not. Also, they may not have the same extras, etc. Plus, laserdiscs are just too cool! PLEASE - DO NOT BID IF YOU DON'T INTEND TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH PAYMENT - I WILL BE FAIR WITH ALL BIDDERS - PLEASE DO THE SAME FOR ME. Thanks! I will be putting up some of the rarest and coolest lasers around in the coming months - PLEASE SEE MY OTHER AUCTIONS. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>DISCLOSURE-VHS-Demi Moore &amp; Michael Douglas DISCLOSURE - VHS - Previously Viewed Starring Michael Douglas and Demi Moore. His career. His marriage. His future. It's all on the line for DigiCom executive Tom Sanders. He rejected the passionate advance of his new boss. Now she's charging him with sexual harassment. Suddenly, long-time company man Tom must scramble for his corporate life - a scramble that will lead him into the dazzling cyber world of DigiCom's new virtual reality corridor...and lay bare a shocking conspiracy among key company personnel. High-tech intrigue and lowdown sexual politics combine in this bristling thriller based on the best seller by Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park, Congo) and directed by Barry Levinson (Rain man, Bugsy).

I'm a registered certified hypnotherapist in Washington state and I have to say that these tapes are fantastic to say the least. This is an original VHS Set.

I'm presenting for your education and entertainment a 4-video tape Richard Bandler on Bandler training seminar using the techniques of Covert Ericksonian Hypnosis and NLP (Neuro Linguistic Programming) submodalities. Here are some of the subjects that you will learn on these amazing and entertaining videos: *Non verbal trance inductions *Arm levitation trances*Handshake and hand kiss interrupt patterns *How to use trance and hypnosis to help you remember things *How you can identify the depth of a trance *Anchoring your highs and firing them at will*Age Regression techniques to cure phobias *Using your subconscious mind to change your life as well as your beliefs.

    <Description>THE TRUCE ~ By Francesco Rosi Awarded DVD NEW This is an Original Official Released DVD. All code region 0 NTSC DVD playable on any DVD players Director: Francesco Rosi Cast : John Turturro, Rade Serbedzija, Massimo Ghini, Stefano Dionisi, Teco Celio, Roberto Citran, Claudio Bisio Dolby Digital Sound / Letter Box / In Original English with Chinese Subtitles / 117 mins The Odyssey of an Italian Jew from Auschwitz to his Home This film had won the Audience Award Best Feature of 1997 Sao Paulo International Film Festival, Best Director, Best Film and Best Producer of 1997 David di Donatello Awards. Italian chemist turned author Primo Levi was interred at Auschwitz during WW II until 1945. Following his release, he returned to his native Turin and penned the wrenching autobiographical account of life in the concentration camp If This Is a Man. In 1962, he wrote a companion book, The Truce, a chronicle of his hellish nine-month journey from the camp to Turin. Both books are crucial entries in the history of the Holocaust. This careful adaptation of the second book took filmmaker Francesco Rosi 10 years to make. Levi's trek begins when shortly after the Germans leave, four Russian horsemen ride up and tear down the gates of Auschwitz. Levi is quickly aboard one of the first outbound trucks. Over the next few months, he goes to many different countries, and along the way he meets and is befriended by assorted fellow travelers. Through them, his appreciation of life and freedom slowly returns, but with it also comes a deep rage and an abiding guilt at having survived, a guilt that may have led Levi to suicide in 1987.

    <Description>Learn your takedowns from the best ever. Wrestlers, Submission Fighters, Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Players and Martial Artists of all kinds will find the info in this seminar incredibly relevant and useful. This is home "AMATEUR" video footage shot at a seminar and is not readily available anywhere else. This tape set is excellent in both quality and content, 8 of 10. In the tape Dan Gable and Tom and Terry Brands demonstrated a tremendous amount of technique from all positions of wrestling. These clinicians need little introduction. Dan Gable may be the greatest wrestler in United States History besides being the legendary Coach at the University of Iowa. He excelled at both NCAA Wrestling and Olympic Wrestling. Tom Brands and Terry Brands have also distinguished themselves at all levels of the sport. If you are a wrestler or a coach this is a tape you will want. Besides the techniques Coach Gable also puts the Brands Brothers through a mini Iowa practice. This in itself is great! These tapes , 3 tapes, last almost six hours and as I said are jam packed with information. Buyer pays shipping of $6.00 if US. Note that our videos are professionally labeled and will fit nicely in your collection. The other guys sloppily hand write their labels, "Yuck".

Equipped with full intellect right from his birth he decides at his third birthday not to grow up as he sees the crazy world around him at the eve of World War II. So he refuses the society and his tin drum symbolizes his protest against the middle-class mentality of his family and neighborhood, which stand for all passive people in Nazi Germany at that time. However, (almost) nobody listens to him, so the catastrophe goes on...

    <Description>This is the crew T-shirt from the Lord of the Rings movie Miniatures Crew. It was given to me by a relative who was a member of the Miniatures Crew.

This is a VHS movie. Written by: Jules Feiffer Starring: Jack Nicholson Candice Bergen All Skinnyguy movies are quality guaranteed. Director Mike Nichols's provocative film, based on a Jules Feiffer script about the changes in America's sexual mores over the course of the three decades, chronicles the bitter experiences of two middle-class American males. Jonathan (Jack Nicholson), a cruel but charismatic misogynist, and Sandy (Art Garfunkel), a bland idealist, meet as roommates at a small New England college in the 1940s. As their friendship progresses through the following decades, their search for the ideal woman leads to failed marriages, bad relationships, and emotional emptiness. Nichols is particularly adept at negotiating the kind of psychological minefield presented in CARNAL KNOWLEDGE. Nicholson is fascinating to watch, but the supporting women, including Candice Bergen and Ann-Margret, supply the soul. Nichols uses a shadowy film noir technique that underscores the movie's exploration of the uncertainty in relationships and also employs long close-ups that offer the characters no roo! m ! to prevaricate in his bleak vision of men, women, and romance.

    <Description>888888888888888888888 sleeping ballerina olga spessivtzeva anton dolin HB PLEASE REMIND ME IF I HAVE FORGOTTEN TO UPLOAD THE SCAN[S]; --- my tracking code for this item is : 116 / def304 CONTENTS : sleeping ballerina olga spessivtzeva anton dolin HB DESCRIPTION. hardbound DATE : 1966 SOURCE DETAILS: frederick muller london CONDITION : good copy; the dust jacket has some tears, but the book is nice , tight and clean LANGUAGE : english MORE INFO : : foreword by dame marie rambert 130 p biography ocr THE SLEEPING BALLERINA The Sleeping Ballerina is the true yet almost unbelievable story of a legendary artiste of the Ballet; a ballerina whose breathtaking perfection of technique and sensitive understanding of her many r_les has never been surpassed and perhaps never equalled. But with her loveliness and genius went an enigmatic contradiction of character that could lead only to tragedy. Olga Spessivtzeva's mental collapse in 1940 was followed by her detention for twenty-two years in the Hudson River State Hospital, New York, almost f_rgotten by the world and those who had hailed her as the successor t_ Pavlova. To a great extent those lost years must remain unwritten, but Anton Dolin, who as an unknown youth first saw Spessivtzeva from the wings, paints a very moving picture of her development as a dancer, her triumphs throughout the world and her relationship with such giants of the ballet world as Fokine, Lifar and Lopoukhova, as well as himself. In unfolding the story of this great Russian star he also makes many be]_i -the-scenes revelations and recritates some of the finest ballet of our time. Ma nificently illustrated, ~~ 9 The Sleeping Ballerina is a book to enrapture anyone with an interest in the arts. THE AUTHOR Anton Dolin needs no introduction as one of the world's finest ballet dancers. The only British male dancer to star with Diaghilev's Russian Ballet, for whom he created many leading r_les, he was principal dancer with the VicWells Company from 1931-35 and founded London's Festival Ballet in 1949, guiding it for twelve years. The author of several books, including a biography of Alicia Markova, he now devotes himself to choreography, which enables him to combine his favourite recreation, travel. i. ///////////////////// \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ Hello and welcome : I try to always list similar items or collections at the same time so check my other auctions for possibly more items like this one !

When Jennifer Gooding (Patsy Kensit) is hired by the mysterious Mr. Cooper (Julian Sands) as governess for his wards Miles and Flora, she expects to enjoy caring for the children.

    <Description>JCAGNEY AUCTIONS!! THE SIMPSONS CHRISTMAS SPECIAL VHS Twas the week before Christmas, but fate played a joke -'No tree and no presents - Homer was broke' According to Bart Simpson, "If TV taught me anything its that miracles always happen to poor kids at Christmas. It happened to Tiny Tim, it happened to the Smurfs, and its going to happen to us" But it better happen fast. The Simpsons are in a yuletide jam - there's no money for presents, and they may have to cancel Christmas! Before the crisis ends, Homer gets a job as a part-time Santa, Bart gets a tattoo, and the whole family - even Grandpa and Marge's nasty sisters - gets into the holiday spirit when they discover the true meaning of Christmas. Video IS STILL SEALED AND IN MINT CONDITION ANY QUESTIONS PLEASE FEEL FREE TO EMAIL ME AT JCAGNEY@HAZLETON.NET WINNING BIDDER to send payment within 7 days of auction's end.

Certainly the booze-oriented, birds-obsessed antics of Martin Clunes' Gary and Neil Morrissey's Tony have become every bit as connected to Britain's collective funny bone as Basil Fawlty's inept hostelry or Ernie Wise's short, hairy legs. Yet, the series could easily have been cancelled when ITV viewers failed to respond to the original version, which featured Clunes sharing his flat with someone named Dermot, played by Harry Enfield. Indeed, it was only when the third series moved to the BBC and was then broadcast in a post-watershed slot--allowing writer Simon Nye greater freedom to explore his characters' saucier ruminations--that the show began to gain a significant audience. By then, of course, Morrissey had become firmly ensconced on the collective pizza-stained sofa, while more screen time was allocated to the boys' respective foils, Caroline Quentin and Leslie Ash. Often glibly dismissed as a lame-brained succession of gags about sex and flatulence, the later series not only featured great performances and sharp-as-nails writing but also sported a contemporary attitude that dared to go where angels, and certainly most other sitcoms, feared to tread. Or, as Gary was once moved to comment about soft-porn lesbian epic Love in a Women's Prison: "It's a serious study of repressed sexuality in a pressure-cooker environment." Series 3 includes: "Lovers" in which Gary becomes worried that he hasn't slept with enough women; "Bed" in which Dorothy and Gary experience problems in the boudoir ("What's the matter? We always have sex after I've cooked for us. That's why I do it."); "Casual Ties" in which a depressed Deborah decides to sell her flat and go travelling, while Tony fails to cheer her up by impersonating different types of Cheese; "Weekend" in which Tony gets a job at The Crown; "Cleaning Lady" in which Tony reconsiders his professional options ("I could be an escort." "What, a car?" asks Gary); "Marriage" in which Gary joins Dorothy for a candlelit dinner ("Why she couldn't find a restaurant with proper lighting I don't know"). Duration: 174 mins The video is in excellent condition and comes in a plastic case with all original artwork and description. It is in US video format, playable on US VCRs. The charge for shipping in the US is $3.00, via USPS with delivery confirmation. Thank You. Payment I accept the following forms of payment: PayPal, Billpoint, Money Order, Personal Check.

Tony rescues the pub's old condom machine as a present for Deborah ("I thought it was something we could enjoy together."); "Cowardice" in which Tony becomes convinced Deborah is going through a lesbian phase; "Your Mate Vs Your Bird" in which increased tension in the household persuades Dorothy to reconsider her living arrangements; "Cardigan" in which Gary, concerned he's becoming middle-aged, suggests they go to a rave; "Rich and Fat" in which Tony goes on a diet after Gary accuses him of being "a bit of a podgemeister"; "Home Made Sauna" in which temptation comes Gary's way when Dorothy and Deborah go away for a sailing weekend.

    <Description>Jane Fonda stars in this brilliant adaptation of Horace McCoy_s acclaimed novel, THEY SHOOT HORSES, DON_T THEY?, directed by Sydney Pollack and featuring Gig Young who won a Best Supporting Actor in 1969. In the depths of the Great Depression, a ragged group of Hollywood hopefuls are drawn together into a bizarre dance marathon, hoping desperately to be spotted by a casting agent, or at least win a shot at the cash prize of $1,500. As the hours pass into weeks of nonstop dancing, desperation mounts and the grim contest evolves into a grueling dance of illusions. This copy has some wear and it shows in the jacket. (Check out my auction for an unopened signed copy that is offered for sale). The running time is 120 minutes and is rated PG. Winner pays the priority shipping and handling.

    <Description>Spawn The Ultimate Collection 4 DVD Set This is a mint, still sealed Spawn The Ultimate Collection 4 DVD set "Animation with balls" That's how Todd McFarlane, the creative force behind the adult-oriented animated series, describes Spawn. And indeed, it is diverting to spend some time watching his disturbingly dark images, replete with bloody violence, sex, nudity, urban crime, corruption, conspiracy, and the intense torment of its antihero, Spawn. This collection contains four DVDs, one for each of the three seasons of Spawn as seen on HBO, plus a supplement disc. The first season establishes the premise and the characters. Government assassin Al Simmons is betrayed and brutally killed by corrupt elements within his own agency. Damned by his past, he's cast into Hell, where he bargains his services to lead the apocalypse in exchange for returning to Earth to be near his wife. But Spawn cannot resume their relationship; he was returned five years after his death and she's remarried - to his best friend. This fuels a seemingly unquenchable rage. But the underlying conflict is whether Spawn can reclaim his humanity and ultimately save himself. As he's driven to further violence, his salvation eludes him. Ultimately, he does regain enough self-control to rebel against the powers of evil and he becomes a free agent, left to battle his own internal demons while external demons taunt him. Spawn 2 continues this saga on the second DVD. Spawn/Simmons discovers who killed him and while confronting the assassin, learns whom in the agency ordered his destruction, Jason Wynn. Spawn is desperate to understand his past, and he struggles to regain the memories stolen from him. Spawn learns the real truth about his friend's apparent betrayal of marrying his widowed wife. A strange benefactor, revealed to have fought his way back from the damned, tries to guide Spawn. He warns Spawn that his only hope is to avoid the violence that harvests evil souls for the demon world. But Spawn is torn between a longing to regain his soul and his passion for revenge. The third HBO season is on DVD three. Spawn finds himself pursued by the police, Wynn and his minions, and assassins from Heaven. It seems that the competition for souls is getting serious and both sides are now playing hard ball. Spawn continues to battle his internal demons, and begins to reveal a long-suppressed nobility. But the forces of evil continue to manipulate his fate. He's tricked into fulfilling an ancient prophecy that may lead to the destruction of all mankind. We learn more about his earthly spirit guide, Cogliostro, and as we do, we come to understand that if Spawn can overcome his rage and once again trust another, he may be able to save himself. This becomes most difficult as a corrupt officer controlled by the sociopath Wynn frames him for a brutal attack on a policeman. As domestic animation goes, the production values are high. The voice actors are effective and feature a few surprising guest stars. The adult themes are thought provoking. As McFarlane explains during his interview, the quality of the animation hovers between Disney theatrical and children's Saturday morning. Be warned: these unrated films are not for children. The Spawn series is graphically violent and somewhat explicit, although there's less sexual content in seasons two and three than in the first, when McFarlane was trying to capture his audience. Video The DVD is presented in its original aspect ratio for television, 4:3 full frame. Digital artifacts are not an issue; the video is consistently excellent with great dynamic range, no noise, and nicely saturated color. Audio The sound is Dolby Digital 4.0 (the rear channels are mono) derived from the original Dolby Surround. Surround information is present, but modest. Score, sound effects, and dialog are consistently clear. The sound improves with each succeeding season. The bandwidth becomes more extended and more low frequency effects are present. The voice actors, looped in the studio, are predominantly recorded very dryly. So with a fine audio system, the voices sound like they could be in the room with you. Supplements Each of the discs has some features in common. Both English and Spanish spoken languages are available, as are English, Spanish, and French subtitles. There are several pages of Todd McFarlane biographical material. And there is an interview with Todd McFarlane which both immediately follows the closing credits and is available from the Special Features menu. Each film offers screen-specific screen-specific audio commentary by McFarlane. In addition, the first disc contains some narrated storyboards and a full-frame trailer for the live action Spawn movie presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and with a higher fidelity than any of the animated films. The third disc contains a behind-the-scenes Featurette with Todd McFarlane in which he discusses the evolution of the character and some differences among the animated series, the live action series, and the comic books. There are also some screens that describe the nature of the characters, and two music videos. The fourth DVD contains supplemental material that complements the extras found on the other three DVDs. There are three storyboards shown simultaneously with the completed animation. There are two "interviews" with Todd McFarlane. The sheer amount of material in this set is daunting. It will take you over eight hours to get through the films and the supplements. If you want to listen to McFarlane's full-length commentaries, be prepared to spend over seven additional hours. Payment can be made in $US, Australian dollars, or French Francs. Winning bidder to add $4.50 for priority shipping in the US. International will be more. Insurance if requested by winning bidder will be extra. Please email if you have further questions. Thank you very much!</Description>

This is a critically acclaimed film and is intended for mature adiences only. "A wake-up all to the world!" - Janet Muslim, The New York Times "Two Thumbs Up!" - Siskel and Ebert "A masertwork!" - Peter Tarvers, Rollings Stone This movie stars: Academy Award Nominee Chloe Sevigny Leo Fitzpatrick Justin Pierce Directed by LARRY CLARK Synopsis: Powerful and passionate, colorful and compelling. Larry Clark's KIDS is 24 frenetic hours in the life of a group of contemporary teenagers who, like all teenagers, believe they are invincible.

Simpson, Linda Evans, Lola Falana, Cameron Mitchell, David Huddleston, David Ladd, and Vic Perrin. A sheriff and a local landowner get involved in a hotbed of action in a racially explosive town!

    <Description>PALLISERS-The**Set 1**BBC*4 DVD**Sealed**NEW* Description This is a brand new factory sealed 4 DVD set! Edition Details:What would you get if you combined the BBC, six Victorian novels, and a cheesy 1970s soap opera? Well, this! The Pallisers is as lavish in its aristocratic intrigues (political scandal and opportunity, lecherous dukes, palatial country houses, a world where everyone knows their place) as it is in its soap opera aesthetic (characters' tumultuous struggles for power, money, love). This made-for-television production is a strange blend of exquisite costuming, remarkable sets, and surprisingly good acting on the one hand and video-quality production and an utterly melodramatic script on the other. Definitely pleasurable viewing for all who enjoy watching the period passion, pomp, and politics of upper-class Victorians. Set 1 contains the first 8 episodes of the BBC's 26-episode serialization of Anthony Trollope's Palliser novels (1865-1880), introducing Plantagenet Palliser and Lady Glencora, whose politically expedient marriage sets the stage for the rest of the Palliser dynasty's saga. The DVD's special features include a 36-page viewer's guide, an interview with Susan Hampshire (Lady Glencora), and information on Anthony Trollope, his fiction, and the Trollope Society. Edition Details: Color, Box set 4-disc Box Set Payment and Shipping IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE WINNING BIDDER! Please DO NOT send payment before reading!

    <Description>THORN BIRDS-THE*4 VHS Box Set*Thornbirds*NEW* Description This is a brand new factory sealed 4 VHS set! I never deal in Bootlegs or Screeners! NTSC format for USA and Canada. You are PRE-ORDERING this auction. The release date is JANUARY 8TH 2002 and will be shipped as early as JANUARY 4TH 2002. The second most-watched miniseries (after Roots) of all time, The Thorn Birds was originally broadcast in 1983 and captivated viewers with its story of a lifelong conflict between the spirit and the flesh. Adapted from the bestselling novel by Colleen McCullough, the production stars Richard Chamberlain as a Catholic priest named Ralph de Bricassart, whose life in Australia between 1920 and 1962 is one long torment as he pines for his lover, Meggie Carson (Rachel Ward), while seeking advancement in his clergyman career. The passion and the guilt make for compelling drama, but a stellar cast of supporting players adds muscle to the proceedings: Barbara Stanwyck (who won an Emmy for her work as Meggie's tough grandmother), Jean Simmons, Richard Kiley, Christopher Plummer, Bryan Brown, and Mare Winningham. Chamberlain, who was something of the king of the miniseries form at the time, is very good in the lead, as is the often-underrated Ward. Their affair is indeed irresistible to watch, which proves to be true, too, of the story's thick weave of church politics, forbidden desire, social change over decades, and family secrets. Edition Details: NTSC format (US and Canada only) Color, HiFi Sound, Box set, NTSC Number of tapes: 4 Payment and Shipping IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE WINNING BIDDER!

    <Description>HEAVENLY CREATURES*Kate Winslet*True*DVD*NEW* Description This DVD is brand-new and factory-sealed! Set in a small New Zealand town in 1952, this disturbing yet fascinating film is the story of two girls from different social backgrounds who become inseparable friends. The stronger their unique bond grows, the more reluctant they are to interact with the outside world, and they begin to invent an alternate reality for themselves from which everyone else is barred. When their parents' intervention finally threatens to disrupt their fantasy, the girls decide to strike back--with horrific consequences.

    <Description>Wild Strawberries DVD by Ingmar Bergman1958 Extremely rare Swedish film! Swedish title: Smultronstallet, theatrical release in 1957 Winner of Berlin International Film Festival in 1958 Starring Victor Sjostrom, Bibi Andersson, Ingrid Thulin, Gunnar Bjornstrand. Directed by Ingmar Bergman. Movie Spec: B&amp;W, Dolby Digital. 91 Minutes ***FULL SCREEN*** -- Smultronstallet/Wild Strawberries is one of the masterpieces of world cinema, a key early representative of the European art films that would change how people thought about movies in the late 1950s and 1960s. While the film posits a frightening questioning of life, it ultimately offers hope and redemption to its dying protagonist, and ultimately to us all. Director Ingmar Bergman effectively alternates emotional warmth with coldness to create one of the screen's greatest philosophical character studies. His shot composition is remarkable, particularly his close-ups of legendary Swedish director Victor Sjostrom, here playing the dying professor. The film is full of masterful symbolic imagery and allegorical storytelling. Most important, Bergman makes his film accessible to the ordinary viewer. This is a warm and human film, strongly filled with a richness rarely experienced on screen. - Richard Gilliam You Playable in region 1 (USA/Canada) DVD player Original Swedish language Removable Chinese subtitles and unremovable English subtitles _Brand New and Factory Sealed!

    <Description>Here's Bette Davis in a black dress, as opposed to the infamous red one which caused such a to-do among the genteel folk of old, deep Dixie. Please note: Due to the size of the item, I had to make two scans and then "stitch" the scans so the entire thing would show. However, stitching causes a horizontal line; this is the fault of the scanner and not that of the photo. Also, since the scan wasn't perfectly lined up, the black dress may appear slightly lighter in color than the rest. Cast your eyes upon the darkest black of the dress and THAT is what this ad looks like. Finally, the background didn't scan well, I probably used the wrong resolution. The ad is huge and beautiful and in EXCELLENT condition; I know of those who would call this "mint." Check out the expression on Bette's face! Dimensions: 9.75" x 13 1/4." Condition: BETTER THAN EXCELLENT, you will love it. Payment: money order or check ONLY, checks must clear. Shipping: $1.25 for First Class.

Murnau introduces Schreck_ as the "ultimate method actor" - one who will appear only in character, in make up, at night. But as the cast and crew begin to disappear, it appears Murnau has made the devil's bargain with Schreck, whose dead-on performance is, perhaps, too authentic!

Parkes Producer Ed Solomon Screenwriter Mary E. Vogt Costume Designer Donald Peterman Director of Photography Bo Welch Production Designer Jim Miller Editor Synopsis: A hilariously stoic top-secret federal agent (Tommy Lee Jones) and his wisecracking partner (Will Smith) don their matching Ray-Bans and skinny black ties and proceed to use all their considerable weaponry and wit to save the world from an undocumented and extremely unfriendly mantislike alien. MEN IN BLACK is a successful, tongue-in-cheek spoof of summer blockbuster alien invasion flicks, based on the comic book by Lowell Cunningham. Description: In the 1950s a super-secret government agency was formed to monitor and police the activities of extraterrestrial aliens on the planet Earth. Some 40 years later a founding father of the agency, Agent Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), finds himself with a new smart-mouthed partner fresh from the NYPD who is soon dubbed Agent Jay (Will Smith). Their first mission is to save the Earth from destruction by a giant insectlike alien (Vincent D__Onfrio) that, incidentally, drives an exterminator__s truck. Armed with their matching Ray-Bans, skinny ties, and space-age weapons that Jay barely understands--he calls the Neuralyzer the "flashy thing"--the new duo begin another average day of fighting intergalactic terrorists. An amazingly hip and terribly clever movie that riffs on everything from E.T.--THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL to CASABLANCA, this Barry Sonnenfeld film is based on the equally savvy comic book by Lowell Cunningham.

    <Description>NOTE : I will only ship this DvD to a USA or Canada address. Please do not bid if you don't live in the USA or Canada as your bid will not be honored. Two important historical documentaries are on the DvD: Mein Kampf (117 minutes): contains authentic World War II German footage of the Warsaw horrors uncovered in the secret archives of the SS Elite Guard.This program is the original documentary released by Columbia Pictures in 1961. Also on the same DvD is... ADOLF HITLER This special British documentary contains fascinating newsreel footage and home movies which chronicle the rise and fall of Adolf Hitler, Chancellor of Germany, leader of the Nazi party and principal architect of World War II. As a FREE bonus for buying the DvD from me the high bidder will receive the video called The Hitler Youth. A fantastic look at Hitler's Youth movement that he had planned on carrying the Reich into the next generation. 10 Million strong in 1945. A quote from Hitler was " I want young people to grow up so that they will frighten the world; a violent, dominant, cruel youth..I do not want intellectual education. Young people must learn to conquer the fear of death - that is standard of a heroic youth." We shall die, but they are the future, the flag we have raised from nothing, we will hand on to them." Items are in stock and in 99.9% of the time, they will ship the same or next day that payment is recieved. Buyer pays $4 for priority mail with delivery confirmation &amp; tracking.</Description>

All will start under $10.00 with NO RESERVE. All posters are in top-quality condition unless otherwise indicated. These are all original movie posters issued by National Screen Service (NSS). They have all been stored flat in an architect's flat file. A few of these posters have creases from having been folded, which is unavoidable, as these particular posters were delivered from NSS folded (several years ago NSS quit folding and mailing posters in envelopes and began shipping all posters rolled in tubes). Collection also includes many lobby cards, standees, and other misc. promos. Folded posters will ship folded and flat posters ship rolled (unless otherwise requested). The collection includes MANY rareties and complete sets. They will be listed in no particular order. A few of the posters have been used for theatre display. It is fairly common for some of them to have minor edge wear or small "dings". I will list noticeable flaws in descriptions, but will not go into deep detail for each individual poster. All sales are guaranteed. If dissatisfied, simply return poster and refund will be sent (less shipping) Frequently check my auctions as I will be listing until they are gone!

    <Description>The Perfect Christmas Gift TVGuardian - The Foul Language Filter This is the newest version available! TVGuardian is a small computer in a box that easily connects between your television set and VCR/DVD/Satellite Dish/Cable Box. TVGuardian continually monitors the closed-captioning embedded in the video signal of broadcast shows and VCR/DVD movies and then automatically detects and filters out offensive words and phrases. TVGuardian references each word against an internal directory of over 100 offensive words and phrases. If a word in the directory is detected, the audio is muted and displays a profanity-free substituted word or phrase on the screen for you. Example: "Get your @&amp;# out of here." the profanity is muted and would display "Get your tail out of here." or "You are full of %@!# ." would display "You are full of crud ." "Winning an Olympic gold Medal took years of hard work. Raising a family is even a greater challenge. Thanks to TVGuardian my job just got a lot easier." Mary Lou Retton Olympic Gold Medallist All cables included in this offer! Simple installation. Approximate size: 5 1/2" wide, 3" high, 4 1/2" deep All units are new in the box!

    <Description>Jack the Ripper. The dvd is new &amp; is factory sealed. Directed by Jesus Franco. Starring Klaus Kinski. Rated R. Graphic violence and nudity. Special features include interactive menus, scene index, and quiz. One of the better efforts from prolific cult director Jesus Franco, this Swiss-German horror film stars Klaus Kinski, in his final film for Franco, as the notorious Jack The Ripper. A respected doctor by day, Kinski bloodily dismembers London prostitutes bynight, until the local inspector's girlfriend (Josephine Chaplin) goes undercover to catch him. Full of graphic gore and nudity, the film is likely to appeal to horror buffs more than Kinski's usual fanbase, but his is a mesmerizing and quite effective performance. Herbert Fuchs and Lina Romay are among the Franco regulars in the cast, with Fuchs turning in an amusing cameo as a would-be extortionist. U.S. shipping and handling is $3.00. International shipping is $4.50. Paypal, Bidpay, U.S. checks, cash and money orders are accepted for payment.</Description>

Her composition teachers in Israel and in the U.S. have included A.U. Boskovich, Paul Ben-Haim, Norman Dello Joio and Ralph Shapey. Her principal piano teachers were Nadia Reisenberg and Dorothy Taubman. Among her numerous awards, fellowships and commissions are those from the Martha Baird Rockefeller Fund, the Ford Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Fromm Music Foundation, WFMT, Chamber Music America, Eastman School of Music, the American Composers Orchestra (Concerto for Orchestra), the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center (Concerto da Camera II), the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters, the Philadelphia Orchestra (Symphony, first performed in 1990, Pulitzer Prize 1991, first place Kennedy Center Friedheim Award, 1992), the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (Legends), the Baltimore Symphony (Vessels of Courage and Hope), the Koussevitzky Music Foundation, and many more. Her first opera, Between Two Worlds (The Dybbuk), which received its much-acclaimed premiere in June, 1997, was commissioned by the Lyric Opera of Chicago, and was described in Opera News as "the most powerful new music-theater piece to emerge from Lyric_s composer-in-residence program." The European premiere of Between Two Worlds took place in May, 1999, at the Bielefeld Opera, in a German translation. Ms. Ran_s Hyperbolae for piano won the competition for a set piece for all participants in the Second Artur Rubinstein International Piano Competition in Israel in 1977. Her East Wind for solo flute was commissioned by the National Flute Association for its 1988 Young Artists Competition. She is presently working on a new work for flute and orchestra, commissioned by the National Flute Association for the organization_s year 2000 convention, and on a concerto for viola for the German violist Tabea Zimmermann. We can look forward to future compositions from this highly respected composer to have the same emotional quality and technical superiority that has led critics to acclaim her work as "written with the same sense of humanity found in Mozart_s most profound opera arias or Mahler's searching symphonies." In 1990, Ms. Ran was appointed by Maestro Daniel Barenboim to be Composer-in-Residence with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra as part of the Meet the Composer Orchestra Residencies Program, a position she held for seven seasons. From 1994 to 1997, Ran also served as the fifth Brena and Lee Freeman Sr. Composer-in-Residence with the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Shulamit Ran, who had performed extensively as a pianist in the U.S., Europe, Israel and elsewhere, is presently the William H. Colvin Professor in the Department of Music at the University of Chicago, where she has taught since 1973. In 1987 she was Visiting Professor at Princeton University. She is the recipient of honorary doctorates from Mount Holyoke College (1988), Spertus Institute (1994), Beloit College (1996), and the New School of Social Research in New York (1997), and was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992. Her works are published by the Theodore Presser Company and by the Israeli Music Institute. Recordings are available on Bridge, CRI, Erato, JMC (Jerusalem Music Center), Koch International Classics and Vox labels, including several all-Ran discs, with recording projects with Teldec (Chicago Symphony Orchestra), New World Records (Peabody Trio), and Gasparo (clarinetist Arthur Campbell) still ahead. http://www.presser.com/ran.html This is a new unsealed CD on Bridge issued in 1995 with TT of 57.28.

    <Description>Double Jeopardy (1993) Starring: Burt Reynolds Jan-Michael Vincent Copy Right 1993: A killer cop faces dual danger when he investigates the poisoning of winos in L.A. and a teen wolf pack that may be responsible for the brutal murder.... Buyer prepays price of movie plus $4.00 shipping and handling via USPS 1st class rate. Payment can be made by check, money order, or by credit card through Paypal. Payment must be made within 10 days of the close of the auction. Please view my other movies on auction and save on shipping. I list hundreds of movies every week. So that you may want to make many purchases I have lowered my shipping charges for multiple purchases. I charge $4.00 for the first movie, $2.00 for the second, and $1.00 for each additional movie. I allow seven days between the close of the first auction and the last. I highly recommend that insurance be purchased for videos shipped in the United States. I cannot and will not be held responsible for movies lost or damaged in the mail. Insurance only costs $1.10 to insure the delivery. If living outside the U.S. postage will be higher and the cost will be confirmed after the auction has closed. International orders cannot be insured. The costs are quite high to do this. All of our movies are previously viewed unless otherwise indicated. The picture depicted is not necessarily the one that is available due to the fact that some movies have various sleeves. Please do not bid if you do not intend to purchase. A $20 dollar service charge will be assessed for bad checks. Shop 1000's of used movies at Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>Imported DVD. Region free and compatible with US DVD players. Brand New and still factory sealed Director Billy Wilder Genre Comedy Released 1959 Length 120 Code All Code (compatible with all DVD player) Language English Subtitle Eng / Indo / Chi / On-Off Format Full Screen B&amp;W Sound Dolby Digital The launching pad for Billy Wilder 's comedy classic was a rusty old German farce, Fanfares of Love , whose two main characters were male musicians so desperate to get a job that they disguise themselves as women and play with an all-girl band in gangster-dominated 1929 Chicago. In this version, musicians Joe ( Tony Curtis ) and Jerry ( Jack Lemmon ) lose their jobs when a speakeasy owned by mob boss Spats Columbo ( George Raft ) is raided by prohibition agent Mulligan ( Pat O'Brien ). Several weeks later, on February 14th, Joe and Jerry get a job perfroming in Urbana and end up witnessing a gangland massacre in a parking garage. Fearing that they will be next on the mobsters' hit lists, Joe devises an ingenious plan for disguising their identities. Soon they are all dolled up and performing as Josephine and Daphne in Sweet Sue's all-girl orchestra. En route to Florida by train with Sweet Sue's band, the boys (girls?) make the acquaintance of Sue's lead singer Sugar Kane ( Marilyn Monroe , in what may be her best performance). Joe and Jerry immediately fall in love, though of course their new feminine identities prevent them from acting on their desires. Still, they are determined to woo her, and they enact an elaborate series of gender-bending ruses complicated by the fact that flirtatious millionaire Osgood Fielding ( Joe E. Brown ) has fallen in love with "Daphne." The plot gets even thicker when Spats Columbo and his boys show up in Florida. Nominated for several Oscars, Some Like It Hot ended up the biggest moneymaking comedy up to 1959. Full of hilarious set pieces and movie in-jokes, it has not tarnished with time and in fact seems to get better with each passing year, as its cross-dressing humor keeps it only more and more up-to-date. ========================================================================= Postage Winning bidder to pay $5.00 for shipping.

    <Description>New Page 1 Happy Holidays Everyone! This is a Blockbuster Previewed Movie and it is in very good condition. _ MOVIE _ _ Ghosts of Mississippi Alternate Title: Los Angeles de Carlitos -- Release Year: 1996 Cast: Alec Baldwin, Whoopi Goldberg, James Woods, William H. Macy, Craig T. Nelson, Bill Cobbs Director: Rob Reiner Categories: Drama, Historical Film Rated: PG13 (Adult Situations ) Running Time: 130 minutes _ _ SYNOPSIS _ _ This is a long-awaited film telling the story of the trials of Medgar Evers' killer. Medger Evers (James Pickens, Jr.) was a black civil-rights activist in Mississippi who was shot to death in 1963. Despite very persuasive evidence that Byron De La Beckwith (James Woods) was indeed his killer, the all-white juries hearing his case at that time acquitted him (he was tried twice). In this film, with the aid of Ever's widow Myrlie (Whoopie Goldberg), Bobby DeLaughter (Alec Baldwin), a young lawyer, gathers enough new evidence to bring Beckwith in for a third trial. Woods' performance as a wise-cracking bigot is one of the film's highlights. ~ Clarke Fountain, All Movie Guide _ _ _ Buy now and get your Items by Christmas.... *** TERMS*** *Please direct all questions to smrtdsgn1@aol.com *Shipping is set at $5.00 and I'm sorry but I am unable to give multiple item shipping discounts at this time._ All the movies are shipped via U.S.P.S.
