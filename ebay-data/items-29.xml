AFTER you receive the notification, click on the link at the very bottom of the email or you can click here. Through the link you will be able to enter your shipping information and select your payment preferences as well as print up an invoice (for snail mail payments) or be taken directly to a payment screen based on your selection.

It's really not difficult folks, I've received far more glowing praise on my system than complaints, but to be honest with you, the complainers are making their lives....and my life....more difficult than necessary. Therefore, just a little side note for those people, "If you are not going to take the time to follow the directions, DO NOT BID ON THIS AUCTION!" If you need help, please ask, I'm more than happy to help those who are sincerely having difficulties. Notice of change in feedback policy: There seems to be this problem -- I leave automatic positive feedback upon shipping and I am currently missing at least 150 feedback comments from bidders who never got around to leaving feedback. So.........now I will revert to my original policy which was in effect prior to July, 2001, of "returning the favor." It works like this: You leave me positive.....I'll leave you positive..... Simple enough? Happy bidding and merry Christmas everyone! Thanks for looking at my auction! Please visit my gallery!!

    <Description>Now offering this 100% nylon Polo Ralph Lauren windbreaker in near new condition. Size is Extra Large. Bright orange. Zipper works perfectly. Has US - POLO on right chest. Elastic at waist and cuffs is tight. Two front pockets are held closed by velcro. Metal snap at collar. No fading or wear that I could see, item is in great shape. After we found it, I wore this once to the Miami/Penn State game. Very comfortable. Reasonable reserve or I keep it for myself. Pay attention, this is the important part. Jacket measures 26" across the chest and 27" from base of collar to bottom hem. Sleeves measure 37" from center of collar to end of cuff. Shoulders measure 24" across from seam to seam. Shipping/handling on this item will be $5.00. Insurance is optional and extra. International shipping to be determined. Payment methods: Billpoint, Paypal (preferred), money orders, and cashiers checks. Personal checks are also accepted with a 10 business day hold for shipment. Please make contact with me by email in the first 3 days. Payment is expected in 10 days, tired of being strung out for a month at a time. My return policy can be found on my ABOUT ME page. NOTE: Avoid checkout if you don't mind, I find it tiresome and confusing. I'll contact you after the auction and we can go from there. Please email me with any questions or for more pics and have a nice day. Check out my store too if you don't have anything better to do.</Description>

    <Description>You are bidding on a NEW pair of Kids Athletic cross training shoes by New Balance. The model number is KX889BP. Size is kids size 11-1/2. Shoe is much prettier than the picture shows - multiple shades of grey, black with a silver thread, and royal blue trim. Shoe also has areas of the 3M Scotchlite reflective material. This material enhances safety at night and in low visibility situations, creating a bright image by returning light back to the light source: for example vehicle headlights. Absolutely brand new in a new crisp factory box. Great for Christmas. At this price, you can afford to buy the size your child currently needs and also the size they will grow into next. Check my other auctions for other sizes - I have them all. ***If you do not have a US shipping address, please do not bid on this item.*** Shipping/Handling charge is $6.00 for insured US Mail. You may pay for your purchase with PayPal, check or money order. I will try to get your item into the mail within 24 hours of receipt of your payment (unless you have horrid feedback and you paid by check). Check my other auctions. I have a lot of listings featuring a wide variety of different kinds of merchandise. Buy more than one item and save on shipping. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>TALKA-ABOUT GIRLIE! This chemise (short slip that the French love) is oooooh so feminine. It's got it all--right from the shimmer and gloss to the lace to the satiny feel to the sexy little spaghetti straps -- and more flowers than a bloomin' garden! And it's a small - for that delicate charming one who will finally own this! Today's small is about a 33/34 bust. You know that Victoria's Secret really knows how to enhance you--so beguiling. And look at this leg area treatment (both sides) with the lace that matches above bodice lace.... ....and what was I saying about a blooming garden. As the English say, you'll be "a bit of all right" wearing this one... Colors are pink, raspberry, teal, Persian blue, wine, vanilla cream, white (the lace)rainbow gold--and all with an icy frost look to fabric but meant for a "warm" gurl. This chemise/slip can be worn under something so you'll feel sexy all day or wear it as a fetching number to sleep in. Personally, I'd be standing too long in front of the mirror if I owned it. You just have to admire yourself and your good taste when you obtain such a beauty. Remember, only one of you gets this. It's new but without tags and has been kept smoke-free, as all my things are. I shop the small and large towns of Southern California to find things I love and hope you will too. I just can't pass by anything floral without it going in my basket. S/H $3.50 Priority Mail. I accept money orders, cashier checks, and PayPal (Visa/MasterCard through PayPal only)--and I will accept personal checks if you have excellent feedback. Don't hesitate to email with questions important to you. I don't always re-list my items, but when I do, I have to increase the cost for my time--so bid early and this time around to save money. This would be so much more at the boutiques. If not for you, great for gift giving and there's still time for the holidays.</Description>

HOLIDAY SHIPPING OPTIONS FOR THE USA We ship almost everything using the US Post Office. If the shipping charge stated is less than $3.50, the item is shipped via first class mail which is normally 2 to 4 days to anywhere in the USA. There is no delivery confirmation available on this and packages in rare instances have taken up to two weeks to arrive (way less than 1% of the time). Past history in shipping tells us that the Post Office actually does a very good job in December, yet with the volume of mail they process, packages do sometimes get misrouted. All items with a stated shipping charge of $3.50 or more are already shipped via priority mail, most with a delivery confirmation. Priority mail shipping with a delivery confirmation number sent to you is available on any item we sell where the shipping charge is stated at under $3.50. The cost for this is $4 and applies to the ties and most of the small ornaments that we are selling. If you want this service just submit $4 in place of any lower shipping amount stated and we will ship priority mail. Express mail overnight shipping is also available at a cost of $13.00 up to 8 ounces (single ties), 8 ounces to 2 pounds at $17 (most plates) and 2 to 3 pounds, $20. This is guaranteed overnight to most of the USA but may take two days to more rural areas. If you want to use this service have your payment in by noon CST or call me at 847-924-8744 and I will let you know if I will be able to get the item out that day.

    <Description>All of my Wednesday auctions start at just one dollar-with no reserve! This auction has an outfit featuring a basketball theme. There is no brand name on it. It is 100 percent acrylic. It has a basketball with the number _32_ on it. It has a ribbed neckline, hemmed leg openings and sleeves. It is relatively lightweight for this type of outfit. This outfit is brand new, but does not have tags. Shipping for this item is $3.50 Priority Mail. I accept Paypal, Billpoint, cashiers check, or money order. Please see my other auctions for more items. I have a lot of nice items and I'm always happy to combine winning auctions to save on shipping. Thank you for looking!</Description>

    <Description>This is one of several necklaces from an estate. It is a very very heavy style made of six gold plated chains woven in an unusual herringbone pattern, yet very supple. The end connector is stamped with "14KGP", which indicates plating. However, since this necklace has been around for a long time and still looks brand new, I believe it is quality. Without looking at the stamped markings, I cannot tell it is not 100% Gold. It is very nice for this price. I accept many forms of payment, including personal checks. I reserve the right to delay shipment until a personal check payment clears. E-mail me with any questions. Please check out my other auctions for great gift ideas!!!! No reserve!!!!

    <Description>**I will be on holiday from Dec 13-Dec 18** SOLD OUT and made famous by comeback queen Kate Moss! 100% AUTHENTICITY GUARANTEED! DO NOT MISS the ultimate ALL NOVA PLAID FITTED LONG SLEEVE SHIRT featuring the infamous NOVA PLAID from BURBERRY's latest BLUE LABEL collection. Comes NEW with TAG and made of 100% COTTON for that amazing fitted look as potrayed by Kate Moss. This masterpiece is made entirely from the BURBERRY signature/nova plaid print -- MAXIMUM EXPOSURE of the ULTRA-HIP BURBERRY PLAID! Burberry logo is embroided on chest and even the buttons have "BURBERRYS" printed. Make no mistake, these are incredibly hard-to-find and expensive, retailed at US$210 at Burberry Boutiques. But this is eBay and the bid for this masterpiece starts merely at US$79.99 with NO RESERVE whatsoever! Bear in mind that I have only limited quantities for this style. Size MEDIUM (M) and measures 15.5" shoulders, 25.6" in length, 17.5" across the underarms, 15.2" sleeves length and 11.2" sleeves opening (the sleeve has a cool vent as shown in pic). All measured from seam to seam. Remember that this is a FITTED shirt and will fit you to a T. Because I bought it directly from the factory, the label was marked or partially torn because by right the factory is not supposed to sell to outsiders. Otherwise PERFECT and BRAND NEW. Shipping will be US$10 to most parts of the world via EXPRESS MAIL. BidPay, International Money Order and cash are accepted. I ship IMMEDIATELY upon confirmation from BidPay and you will receive the shirt within 5 business days. Money Order/Cash averagely takes 10 days to reach me, so the whole transaction can take 21 days or more. All sales final and thanks for dropping by!</Description>

    <Description>* In Due Time Dress Small * This cute dress is so comfy! It is made of 100% poly stretch velour in dark navy. It has a scooped neckline and a shorter cut at 35" from shoulder to hem. It is generous through the waist, but it doesn't have that maternity look -- so it's great for those early months of pregnancy and those couple of post-pregnancy months when your regular clothes just don't fit as they once did! Although it has been worn, it looks new and shows no signs of wear! Since it's getting so close to the holidays, I'm running this as a 5 day auction! You can have this in plenty of time to use for a Christmas gift! Please take a look at my other listings for treasures for the WHOLE family, most of them new with tags!!

    <Description>This auction is for 2 maternity dresses. One is black and the other is a greenish color (see picture). They are both from Take Nine Maternity. The black one is Small while the green one is Medium. I was pregnant with twins when I wore these dresses. I am normally a size medium and got quite big while pregnant. They both fit me pretty much the same despite the size difference on the labels. Green dress: 73% Rayon 27% Polyester. Black dress: 70% Rayon 30% Polyester. Both dresses have three cream colored roses on the bodice. The dresses have a crepe like look to them. They say dry clean only but I guarantee that I didn't dry clean them. I just threw them in the wash with cold water. I believe I even put them in the dryer. They do need ironing if you hang them to dry. They are very comfortable and fairly long. I am 5' 7" and they came down to just above my ankles. I am just including a picture of the green one but the black is exactly the same other than the color. Please email me for further pictures or with any questions you may have. Thank you and Happy Bidding! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>_ LETS MAKE A DEAL BID ON OUR " BRAND NEW " BRAND NAME ITEMS AND YOU WILL BE WINNING AT THE COST OF BIG SAVINGS Brand Name: Emma James (Liz Claiborne) Retail: US $78 Measurements Bust: N/A Waist: N/A Chest: N/A Hips: N/A Shoulder: N/A Length: N/A Fabric: 55/45 Acrylic/ Cotton Color: Lavender Size: L sweater XL top Closure:Button Description Beautiful Liz C. Lavender twin set. L sweater jacket XL top, Condition: New with tag Ask questions before bidding please. No returns! :) S&amp;H is $4.50 on this Item (USA ONLY) I accept Paypal, Mo or check (but I hold checks til they clear) Payment must be made within 10 days of auction end! If you are outside the USA, please contact me before bidding. _ ****See my other Auction items**** This applies to items shipped First Class Only!! Note: As a seller it's sometimes hard to determine the exact shipping price on an item. Sometimes it might cost less then what I anticipate, and sometimes more. If it costs more, I pay the difference, but then again, if it costs a little less, I do not make refunds. I think that's fair. I charge only $2.50 for shipping because I ship First Class in a yellow envelope. The item is wrapped in tissue paper, then placed in a large zip lock bag so that in case it rains it will hopefully not get wet. I haven't had any problems so far, but I will ship priority if you desire. The price for shipping (and handling) priority is $4.00 on one item (more for multiple). I am also not responsible for lost or damaged items. If you are the high bidder and you'd like your item insured, please advise me before payment is submitted. At auction end you will receive a confirmation from me via Paypal. Happy Holidays</Description>

    <Description>This Eskimo/Inuit parka has hardly been worn - the paint on the heavy metal 2 way zipper is all intact. The dusty rose parka is 100% wool with a white quilted lining and the hood has what appears to be fox fur trim. The grey diamond and snowflake designs are leather and the other is embroidered with white and grey wool. These designs go across the back of the parka also.

    <Description>This lovely belt and others (see my other auctions!) are on consignment with me just in time for the holiday season! They all come from a fabulous non smokers home. This auction is for an Authentic Vintage Hermes belt. I do not know the style or the date of this belt. However, the two Hermes bags (from the same client) I just sold are from the 1960's, therefore I am assuming this is from then as well. The belt is a wonderful dark green and is in very good condition. ( Another Hermes belt I have from this client came with an OLD price and size tag from Bonwit Teller. The original price - back in the 60's? - was $60 and it says it is a 28 INS size.) I did some rough measurements as well: it measures a hefty 2 inches wide and 32 inches long from tip to tip, although the belt is curved for a nice fit. I also tried to measure from the "loosest" hole to the clasp and it seemed to measure approx 31 inches, but it is very hard to tell since it's curved. It does have 6 holes for adjustability and the clasp is a kind of C shaped hook. Inside the belt there is a loop to tuck the end into when it's on. This belt does appear to have some very slight cracks in the green leather at the edges - possibly it is a bit dry? They are only barely noticible - they do not detract at all. Inside it is marked in various places - by the hook: Made in France; and in the center: Bonwit Teller Hermes Paris. I could not find a marking on the clasp. The belt comes in its original Hermes orange box. The box measures approx 7" x 7" x 2 1/2". Overall it is in very good condition with only minor wear on the corners. Also someone wrote "green" inside the lid in pen. There is no dust bag for this item. This is an absolutly fabulous find, a true vintage Hermes in such mint condition. It looks as if was hardly ever used. This is a lovely belt in exellent condition - you basically couldn't ask from more from a vintage Hermes belt! As this is such a rare find I have put a reserve on it to protect my client(but it not much more than the original price!). If you would like more info or photos please email me and I'll do what I can. Don't forget the holidays are getting closer - this would make an unforgettable gift!!! High bidder will pay all costs of packing, shipping and insurance. All money must be in US currency. Personal (&amp; business) checks will be held at least two weeks before the item is shipped (no exceptions!). Send a money order or cashier's check for faster shipping!! I will also accept Biday and Paypal for this auction. Payment must be received within 10 days of the end of the auction or risk losing the right to buy and negative feedback. High bidders in the state of NJ must add on the 6% state sales tax. Please email me with any questions &amp; good luck bidding!!</Description>

    <Description>This is a really cute Tommy Hilfiger long sleeved top. The tag says it's a size 3T, but it fit my girl like a 2T. No rips, stains or holes. But I had to bleach the collar to clean it and so it's white with blue stitching instead of baby blue in color. Looks totally natural though~ can't tell that it used to be baby blue in color. The front has one embroidered Tommy logo star on it with a baby blue and a silver star embroidered on each side of that. My favorite part is the the edges are kind of ruffly, they call it lettuce edging, makes it look really cute around the bottom and the sleeves. It also has baby blue around the bottom and the sleeves. The left sleeve also has an embroidered red, white and blue logo star on it. The back snaps up 3 times down from the nape for easy on and off the head. Cute top! Made of 100% cotton. Please check out my other auctions for more mens, womens and childrens clothing ALL NAME BRAND. I have triplets and have tons of stuff to sell. I would also love to combine shipping on multiples auctions for you. Shipping is either $2.50 regular mail OR $3.70 priority mail.

    <Description>BRAND NEW - 2001 Tommy Hilfiger Clogs Photo does not do these great clogs justice at all! They are soft and shiny black, not dull as pics show. I bought this last month on ebay and never wore them because they are big for me, even with socks, my heels slide off the clogs (which have a short heel support which is very nice). Description says 7 1/2, it might be a little bigger than that as I wear 7 to 7 1/2. I just want to get some money back. Here is the seller's description, which is very accurate - except the box says USA 8M (8 was crossed and 7 1/2 was penned in), UK 5 1/2 M. EUR 39M. What I have for you is a brand new, never before used pair of 2001 Tommy Hilfiger clogs size 7 1/2M. Guaranteed authentic and brand new still in the box, with tissue and all! Ever in a hurry? These black clogs are great and a must for the person on the go. They are made of genuine buttery soft leather. The inside is cushioned so these clogs are extremely comfortable! The sole of these shoes are skid resistant, awesome! They will go great with your dresses, jeans or slacks. These clogs can be used for shopping or anywhere you plan to do alot of walking. They are definitely an eye catcher. I guarantee your friends will adore them and so will you. I purchased them last month while on vacation and never wore them. Enough of me raving about them, you be the judge, look at the pictures. They can be yours today for a fraction of the price. These clogs were purchased at Carson Pirie Scott in downtown Chicago for much more. At these prices you can have shoes in every color for every outfit. I took several pics so you can see how nice these are - wish they really fit me! Good luck and thank you for looking! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Visit Wigs of Juvilee today!

    <Description>This t-shirt is 100 % cotton, pre-shrunk, double-stitched on the seams. The size is a generously-cut XL, the shirt colour is Sapphire Blue. The shirt is BRAND-NEW and never worn, bagged in plastic with all the original tags. The magnificent Celtic unicorn is a creature of the moon - wise, graceful and beautiful. The Unicorn represents purity, chastity and gentleness, and was a common subject for medieval tapestries and decorative art. They are noble, solitary and intelligent and act as protectors and guardians for other woodland beasts.However, they become savage and fierce fighters when threatened. Their horn was a magical cure for all illness and so they were often hunted for their horns. Today, they represent power,inner beauty, gentleness and a love for all creatures. After 4 years of travelling to Celtic festivals, we're tired and want to stay home and get a life :) Therefore we're selling our entire regular inventory at great discount prices! I accept PayPal, BidPay, all INTERNATIONAL money orders, well-hidden cash. If your positive feedback is 50 OR MORE, I will acept a personal cheque. If you're in Europe, I am only able to accept BidPay, PayPal or well-hidden cash :) Shipping anywhere in Canada or the U.S. is $2.60 by Surface or $3.60 by Airmail. Please see my other Celtic tee auctions - thanks for looking!</Description>

Has a little elasticity at the waist. Very comfy. Condition: New with tag Ask questions before bidding please. No returns! :) S&amp;H is $4.50 on this Item (USA ONLY) I accept Paypal, Mo or check (but I hold checks til they clear) Payment must be made within 10 days of auction end! If you are outside the USA, please contact me before bidding. _ ****See my other Auction items**** This applies to items shipped First Class Only!! Note: As a seller it's sometimes hard to determine the exact shipping price on an item. Sometimes it might cost less then what I anticipate, and sometimes more. If it costs more, I pay the difference, but then again, if it costs a little less, I do not make refunds. I think that's fair. I charge only $2.50 for shipping because I ship First Class in a yellow envelope. The item is wrapped in tissue paper, then placed in a large zip lock bag so that in case it rains it will hopefully not get wet. I haven't had any problems so far, but I will ship priority if you desire. The price for shipping (and handling) priority is $4.00 on one item (more for multiple). I am also not responsible for lost or damaged items. If you are the high bidder and you'd like your item insured, please advise me before payment is submitted. At auction end you will receive a confirmation from me via Paypal. Please read it carefully for my shipping address. Happy Holidays</Description>

    <Description>This is a cute little black knit jumpsuit trimmed in pink. It buttons up the front and has two pockets in the front also. It is in good condition other then a couple of tiny (less then 1/8 an inch) holes around the knee area. This would make a very comfortable play outfit. My daughter loved it! These come from a nonsmoking home. With all the terrorist scares I prefer Paypal, Billpoint, or even another online payment service. You pay only exact shipping charges with your choice of Parcel Post or Priority Mail. Win more then one auction and save on shipping! Thanks for looking and good luck!</Description>

    <Description>SILVER SEQUINED 2-1/2" HEELS 7AA Stuart Weitzman for Joseph. Made in Spain. Fine net and sequin uppers, leather soles. These are really beautiful, delicate shoes. Size 7AA. 2-1/2" heels (measured from the inside). Because of their age the glue is seeping around the bottom edges (where the leather sole is glued to the upper section and the heel) and has darkened to a brown color (see scans below). They've been worn just a couple of times but the inside sole shows wear (the inside sole is actually gold although it looks more like silver in the photo). NO RESERVE. Buyer pays $5.00 S&amp;H. International rates will have to be determined. If you are bidding on more than one of my auctions, if you wish, I will wait until all of your auctions are finished and combine shipping charges. It just occurred to me that those of you who send money orders must pay for them most of the time, so I want you to know that I also happily accept checks (sorry, international buyers international money orders written on a US bank in US funds only ). Or see below for PAYPAL.

    <Description>Welcome. Check out this great Victoria's Secret white cotton sports bra with mesh insets. Cool cotton/spandex molded cups with mesh inset in middle. Back and straps are all cool, stretchable mesh. It has the Victoria's Secret label inside but because it is dead stock, the size label is missing. Mannequin is Size 34 and it is big on her so it seems to be a size 36-B. Closes in back with three sets of hooks and eyes. This is new and has never been worn. The only flaw is a tiny blue shadow mark on right front which is barely noticeable (possibly from storing it near a blue slip) and would probably come out in wash cycle. In like-new condition otherwise. Victoria's Secret at a low, low price. This bra will provide great support for your workouts or sports. Buyer pays $3.90 US Priority postage which includes Delivery Confirmation. Bid with confidence (check our feedback). All sales are FINAL so please e-mail questions before bidding. We accept Billpoint, money orders and checks (but NO PayPal) and payment is due within ten days after auction closes. Thanks for looking and Happy Holidays.</Description>

Sign up today. It's FREE, FAST, and get paid $5.00 to do it! What a deal! That about covers the shipping cost for this item! Please visit our many other auctions BID WITH CONFIDENCE! 2,000+ Positive Feedbacks! If this is your first time bidding with us, please read our FAQ Page. If you cannot comply with the terms of the auction, please do not bid. FAQ HOW CAN YOU SELL SO CHEAP? WHERE DO YOU GET THE STUFF? We specialize in the remarketing of New, Used, and Distressed Merchandise. These items are from overstock warehouses, company liquidations, freight claims, bulk auctions, and insurance purchases. This means that some items may be missing manuals, cords, cables, disks, factory packaging and/or may have light to severe damage. Please read the ENTIRE auction and ask ALL questions prior to bidding. We suggest you call or visit the manufacturer's page for detailed information. Items may have come originally with accessories such as remotes, cables, or batteries. If it's not listed in the description, don't expect it. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "UNTESTED" AND "AS-IS"? Please understand that our warehouse does not have the equipment, facilities, or time to fully test every item. We offer a "cursory" inspection on all items and list our findings in the auction description. We supply all available Make/Model information for you to review and research. Please do your own research prior to bidding. All items and contents are described to the best of our ability. Unless the auction description states differently, these items are sold and "as-is". We reserve the right to refuse sale or service for any reason. WHEN SHOULD I SEND PAYMENT? Payment is due within 10 days of the closing of the auction. Otherwise, we reserve the right to re-post or re-sell this item and request credit from eBay, at our discretion. Acceptable forms of payment include Cashier Checks, Money Orders, and Bank Wire Transfers. If necessary, we can accept personal or company checks. We normally ship within 3-5 business days for certified funds. We hold all checks for 7-10 working days for validation. We do not use I-Escrow or any other escrow company. Other payment terms may be available and will be disclosed in our "Payment Email" that will be sent to you at the end of the auction. Unless otherwise stated, Sales are final. All others we offer a 50% restocking fee for any returns, less shipping and paypal fees (if applicable). I WON MORE THAN ONE ITEM OR I AM BIDDING ON MORE OF YOUR AUCTIONS. SHOULD I WAIT AND SEND PAYMENTS ALL AT ONCE? I MAY SAVE A BUCK OR TWO? Although we appreciate you bidding on more of our items, it would be more efficient if you sent in each payment as the item closes. We use an automated system and it sends out confirmations, feedbacks, Non-Pay Bidder Reminders, and other eBay related operations automatically. That's why it's so important to get payment in within 10 days of the close of the auction and keep auctions as separate transactions. If you delay, you may get warnings from eBay or you may actually lose your item because it got re-posted. We also do not combine shipping fees because we ship from various warehouses and cannot guarantee that items will be shipped together. Also, it requires us to manually do each multiple order and that interferes with our automated system. Therfore, we do not combine shipping fees. If you get multiple items shipped together, it's just a matter of luck and chance. HOW DO YOU SHIP WITH AND WHAT IF I'M OUTSIDE YOUR STANDARD SHIPPING AREA? We ship via UPS Ground from Connecticut, 06804. For books, videos, CDs video games and other media we may offer Media Mail Rates. If available, it would be listed in the auction description. We cannot ship to PO BOXES or Military APO addresses. If you are outside the 48 contiguous US states, shipping fees are more. Please contact us for the estimated rates prior to bidding. PAYPAL USERS: We can ONLY ship to verified Paypal addresses. If you want it shipped to a different address send your payment via the mail. Whenever possible, we will provide shipping weights and/or fixed shipping costs. Fixed shipping rates are for shipping within the 48 contiguous states. If you are outside of this area, contact us prior to bidding. Shipping will be higher. Sorry, we do not combine shipping fees. It screws up our automated accounting and shipping programs. HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN YOU RECEIVE MY PAYMENT OR WHEN MY ITEM IS SHIPPED? We issue the buyer a Positive Feedback the day your payment is received and entered. You can use this as a reference of when your item will be shipped. If you provide us an email, we will email you a tracking number. All shipping questions should be directed to shipping@highendequipment.com. We are no longer responsible for items once it is picked up by the courier. If damage occurs during transit, we will assist in the claims process. No product refunds will be issued until the claim is paid. Shipping fees are not refundable for any reason. ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE I BID? Please read all the information on the auction and do your research prior to bidding. If you have any questions, please call our office at 203-740-9111 or email us at inquiry@highendequipment.com. By placing a bid on this auction you are confirming that you have read all the information, asked all your questions, and understand the terms of this auction. NICE FEEDBACK RATING, BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY NEGATIVES? The fact of the matter is, we are only human. We do make mistakes. We also use automated systems and internet based platforms to help automate the selling process. We can fix our human errors, unfortunately the others are not as easy. We can't fix external programs like eBay or AuctionWatch. Most problems can be resolved with one phone call. We try our best to service all customers and when we make a mistake, we take care of it. Not every buyer gives us the opportunity to correct for our mistakes. Most of our negatives are from new users who don't understand or respect the rules of eBay. They don't read the auctions and are not very good shoppers. If a problem comes up, they SLAM a Negative Feedback and not even give us a chance to address the issue. Basically, when we are given the opportunity, we take care of everybody. Hey, you can't be an eBay PowerSeller without doing something right! MAN, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS RETURN EMAILS FASTER? Everyone in our company travels frequently to find the best deals to bring to you on eBay. Therefore, it is difficult for us to return emails in a timely manner. If all else fails, call our office for assistance. 203-740-9111. Office hours are Mon-Fri 9am-5pm EST. We strive to bring you the best items at the very best prices possible!

Approximate measurements are: 6" high (without handles) X 8" wide, 27" high with shoulderstrap. Brand new, never used, mint condition.

At the waist there are three shiny black buttons and it ties in the back. This dress is perfect for winter with a long sleeve shirt and even works in spring with a short sleeve shirt underneath.

I ship USPS Priority Mail only, please don't ask for any other type of shipping. Payment by Money Order, Cashier's Check, Cash, or Paypal ONLY (no personal checks).

    <Description>Here is a very nice 100% Imported Silk mens tie by "Rustica". I purchased it at Macys' for my hubby because I liked it so well, ignoring the fact that he said he can only wear extra long ties. Needless to say, he wore it once and it IS just too short!(he's 6'4" I guess I should have listened!) It measures 56" long from one end to the other. I don't know how mens ties are sized so I hope that tells you if it will fit. Basically it is a regular size. It is a nice navy blue with olive colored rings and a hint of white. The inside of the rings have a more solid navy than the rest of the tie. It is in LIKE NEW XLNT condition. BID NOW!! ***THE WORD IS OUT!! My friends know that I'm selling on eBay so now I am selling some of their clothes as well as our own. Good for you because it will mean a lagrer assortment of clothes and sizes. HOWEVER, I told them I will ONLY sell 'like new' condition with NO spots or rips &amp; GOOD QUALITY clothes. I have to keep the reputation of XLNT conndition and quality! So let your friends know that I may have their sizes now too and not just my 12, 14 &amp; 16's. THANKS FOR LOOKING &amp; KEEP CHECKING! ***PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT INFORMATION our fine but important print! ***As far as payments go, we PREFER PAYPAL but we do accept checks and money orders, it just takes longer to receive payment therefore it takes longer to ship your item!

    <Description>Cuban Heel Back Seam Stockings Black 10 L This auction is for three pairs of Imported from Belgium, Back Seam, Ultra Sheer Stockings, Color BLACK (NOIR), Size 10 L (33-1/2 inches) with a "Cuban" styled reinforced Heel and sandal toe, this makes them very UNIQUE! In Europe this style is called French Heel. The stockings are 12 Denier 100% Nylon, Flat knit to make them super sheer like Hanes or Christian Dior; in my view these are perhaps even sheerer and nicer and very Rare for sure! Buyer pays S&amp;H $4.00 to a U.S.address via Priority Mail, International bidders please E-Mail for Air Mail Rates to your country. Please look at my other auctions. Visit my Ebay Store for unadvertised unlisted bargains and great LOW prices, ONLY @ "THE HOSIERY DEPOT". We sell nothing BUT HOSIERY! Thank You!
