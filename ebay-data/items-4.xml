    <Description>Two unique Norman Rockwell Plates, each measuring 8 1/2" in circumference . Ideal for collectors of hard to find Rockwell Plates . Cast in 1981, these plates are white with renditions of the actual oil paintings measuring 5" in circumference in the middle. The first plate is Rockwell's painting of " Artists Daughter ", a close depiction of Rockwell's own "Self-Portrait". This painting shows a small girl at an easel painting a picture of her small cherished doll.The background lighting of the picture is a soft amber glow, and the determination on the little girl's face is delightful. This is dated sixth in the series, 1981 The second plate is the painting titled " The Tinkerer ",showing an old man and his cat tinkering away on an old copper teapot, with a charming library background. This too is dated 1981 and is fifth in the series. Both plates are in mint condition with the exception of very small chips in the center rim of the back which are hard to see, and do not affect the front of the plate at all. The stamp on the back of "The Tinkerer" looks a bit askewed from when originally stamped. These make perfect Holiday gifts! Buyer to pay shipping and handling of 4.95. PayPal is the preferred payment and can ensure your gifts arrive in time for Christmas. I also accept money orders and cashiers checks. No personal checks please. Buyer to make contact within three days of auction closing, and payment to be received within 10 days of auction closing. United States residents only please. I apologize for the lack of pictures, but I felt they did not do the plates justice with the glare.</Description>

    <Description>This is a wonderful Vintage Tablecloth. I believe this is all Cotton. Size is larger than most: measures 50" by 64". Overall colour is white with primary accents of red, yellow, blue and green. Has a Kitchen Utensil and Food Motif. The perimeter has a 3" yellow border with white polka-dots. Each corner has a different saying; for example, "The Kitchen's best for all of these--Where Folks relax and eat in ease!"This is charming indeed. Included are teapots, menu boards, herbs, cows on pitchers, tomatoes, pots, pans, cherries, etc. This is in overall good condition for its age which I date to the 1960's. No holes, rips or odors. I have not washed this and there are some spots here and there which as you know is quite typical for this kind of item. Please do not bid if you are looking for a Cloth in "mint" condition. This one is not "mint" but I believe you would be pleased: there is way more good than not. Please plan on $3.50 for actual U.S. Priority Shipping. Thank you very much--mybonny Payment I accept the following forms of payment: PayPal, Money Order, Personal Check.

The designs of this region are varied and are not used as a guide to the origin of the rug. Distinctive designs are associated with particular towns and villages such as Bibikabad, Ingelas, Dergezin, and Husianabad, all are generally referred to as Hamadans. Key characteristics are similarities in weave and colors. Almost all Hamadans are single wefted, a row of weft runs between each row of knots, using the Turkish/Symmetrical knot, with 40-100 knots per square inch. Most of the rugs of this region use similar strong, dark colors, including reds, blues, ivory and brown. Often they are woven mixing goat or camel hair mixed with wool or cotton. Designs are bold and geometric, incorporating many hexagonal and diamond-shaped designs including sharply angled medallions and zigzag patterns, which represent lightening. Stylized florals and utilization of the herati pattern are also quite common. Many older pieces, mostly runners, were woven on wool foundations with undyed camel hair and are therefore camel colored. Modern rugs have cotton foundations with stronger, darker colors, often with bright accent colors. It is now very rare to find them in the classic camel color. Hamadans are considered some of the best values in Persian rugs. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

    <Description>You are bidding on one brand new never used green Mongoose brand water pack (tag still attached). It is the backpack style no hands drinking system that is perfect for all sorts of sports or hiking. I use mine while motorcycling - allows me to drink on the fly without removing my helmet. It has a tube connected to the included water bladder that clips to your shirt or whatever you want to attach it to.You just drink from the tube (like a long straw). When you're done drinking, just close the valve on the end and it won't leak. The adjustable elastic straps on the front allows it to hold the bladder securely in its pack or they can even be used to carry a windbreaker with you (that's what I do). It has two fully adjustable shoulder straps that keeps the pack securely on your back as well as a strap that goes around your waist. Other features as identified by the tag: Holds 2 liters, Adjustable/padded waistbelt and External pockets for added storage.The pack also allows you to move the drink tube from the right side to the left side. Why pay the price they want for these at stores. Perfect for an X-mas gift. E-mail me with any questions you may have. Buyer to include $5.00 for shipping to anywhere in the continental US. I will ship within 1 business day of receiving payment. I accept Paypal, money orders or checks (I will wait for a check to clear before shipping). Thanx for looking!!!

Doyle (same location) Nice original, high-gloss, black-and-white portrait measures 3-1/2" X 4-3/8" - a bit light - in excellent condition Don't let the scan turn you off - this photo is as sharp as a pin To afford protection while in transit, the item will be sandwiched between two pieces of 3-1/2" X 5-3/4" cardboard in an ordinary envelope. Shipping will be $ .57 via USPS First Class Mail. For insurance, add $ 1.10. CHECK OUT THE OTHER SUPER NICE PHOTOS I HAVE LISTED Note: I try to give as accurate a description as possible. If more details are needed, ask before you bid. IF YOU INTEND TO BID ON THIS ITEM, READ ALL OF THE FOLLOWING : TYPE OF AUCTION There is NO RESERVE on this auction. This item WILL sell to the highest bidder. Low opening bid is to encourage bidding, not to suggest an item has a low value. I reserve the right to withdraw an auction item at any time, if a listing error is discovered. SCANS The scan included in this auction may not represent the actual size of the item/s. Most have been reduced from actual size to fit eBay's format. Scans may not properly depict the actual clarity and colors._ Darker objects are sometimes lightened to show detail. Additional scans are available via e-mail upon request, if needed. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS, PLEASE E-MAIL ME PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS, BEFORE BIDDING ON THIS ITEM! TERMS OF AUCTION Each auction will be conducted in accordance with eBay guidelines. Item descriptions and their condition are presented with the intent to be honest and fair. All items are sold on an as is basis and not returnable. END OF AUCTION I DO NOT participate in eBay's complicated and controversial "Checkout" option. I generally e-mail a notification to winning bidders within 24 hours of the end of each auction. Please respond to my e-mail within 3 days (per eBay's terms). I need to know you have received my notification. Include your mailing address , so I can begin preparing your purchase for shipment. Always make reference to the eBay Auction Item Number in all communications. PAYMENT TERMS Payment must be received within 7-10 days of the close of the auction. If it is not received by then, I reserve the right to offer the item to the second highest bidder. I accept payment by money order, certified check or personal check. I also accept cash, but it is sent at your own risk! I DO NOT accept payment through intermediate sources! NO CREDIT CARDS, PAY PAL, BILLPOINT, or other services! Note:_ Non-replying or non-paying bidders will be reported to eBay without exception! SHIPPING I only ship to the United States!_ If you live in another country, please do not bid! Buyer to pay the amount indicated above for shipping and handling of this item. Handling charges are to cover the cost for padded envelopes, pressure-sensitive tape, etc. I do my very best in packing all items to ensure they do not incur damage in transit. My responsibility for protection ceases when an item leaves my hands. Insurance is a recommended option and is a buyer's only recourse if something is lost. SHIPPING SCHEDULE Most items are shipped by USPS Priority Mail. Some paper items (i.e. photos, magazines, etc.) will be shipped by First Class Mail. Items will be shipped ASAP after receipt of payment. Shipment of items paid for by personal check may be delayed for a period of from 7-10 working days, until it clears the bank. Because I cannot go to the bank every day, that is based on date of deposit, which is not always the date of receipt. Insofar as delivery is concerned, there have been sporadic delays in mail distribution, due to the anthrax threat. I have no control over this. If you are the successful bidder on more than one of my auctions, that close within a 3-day period, I will combine the shipping for you. I no longer send Shipping Notices. FEEDBACK I generally post feedback for buyers within 2-3 days after receipt of payment. Hopefully, I will be worthy of reciprocation. - - - - - THANK YOU FOR VIEWING THIS AUCTION - - - - - CLICK HERE TO SEE MY OTHER AUCTIONS Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>This "Gowron" figurine signed by Robert O'Reilly the actor has been carefully built and painted by a professional master modeler. I purchased it from him a few months ago. He did not want to sell it after winning several awards and getting the signature himself, he had somewhat of an emotional attachment. He owed me several favors, so he allowed me to purchase it from him for $500.00. Now is your chance to obtain a piece of unique Star Trek history. My digital camera cannot pick up the detail in the figureine but you can still tell it has been carefully modeled and painted. Over 40 hours of work went into it. Comes on its own base. As much as I'd hate to part with it, I must. The Klingon Empire would pay a heavy randsome for this piece. Questions? Email me at pharmacy@mediaone.net.

    <Description>Periscopic aircraft sextant manufactured by the Kollsman Instrument Corp., MS 28011-5, REF. NO. 6605-00515-4834, MFR'S, STOCK NO. 6225-1471C-02, Honeywell repair tag dated April/18/89, REF NO.6605-00-515-4834. Now here is a very impressive and intricate navigational instrument! This is the periscopic sextant that was used by the USAF and CAF during the last 45 years. It was used on the B-47, B-52, C-54, C-97, C-118, C-119, C-121, C-124, KC-135, and other aircraft. It was used by the navigator or other crewmember to determine the altitude of a celestial body measured and recorded with reference to a bubble artificial horizon. A two power lens is incorporated into the periscope. Inertial and doppler navigation systems as well as GPS systems replaced the navigator and celestial navigation with this sextant. To illuminate the bubble and altitude counter a 28 volt D.C. aircraft supply was used. The sextant pictured below comes complete with a power connecting cable, spare light bulbs, and fiberglass storage case. It is in very good used condition, but sold as is. This is a fantastic gift for an aviation memorabilia collector, or former crew member on one of the above airplanes, so don't delay in your bidding. This is a nice sextant and it is hard to find a complete set with the case and the power cord. so bid before they are gone. Pls. check my feed-back on the condition of these equipment that I have already sold. I still have a few units left. Email me your question and I'll answer it the best I can .

This semi-cabin bitters bottle is listed in Rings reference book as D-93 it retains 80% of the original front label and 95% of the reverse label for 'HOP BITTERS'. A fairly common yet desireable semi-cabin without the labels, these are hard to locate with the original labels intact. Has NO DAMAGE, has the original cork still stuck in the top and has slight content residue that would clean up in a jiff if desired, but doesn't detract at all the way it is. We will let the new owners make that decision! Color is a lighter yellowish amber and displays so much better with the labels. They make it seem taller or something. Bottle is 9 5/8" tall. Embossed; "DOYLES / HOP / BITTERS / 1872" on the four roof panels and (hop &amp; Leaf motif) embossed on the front panel. A TERRIFIC DISPLAY PIECE IN JUST ABOUT PERFECT CONDITION!

    <Description>BATMAN: THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN #2 First Printing. In 1986, a groundbreaking miniseries took the industry by storm, revolutionizing forever the way people envisioned the comic-book medium. Now acclaimed writer/artist Frank Miller is set to do it again, with the most anticipated comics sequel of all time... THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN. It's been three years since the events of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS, and everything is just fine. Perfect, in fact. At least on the surface. What the world at large doesn't know is that it's a total sham. A perfectly choreographed, pretty little world where everything that's ugly, or even potentially disturbing, is all nicely wrapped up with neat little ribbons and swept under the carpet. Only he knows better. He's watched it fester to near-breaking point, and it's time for the only free man left who can effect any real change to bring it all down around their ears, once and for all. It's not gonna be pretty. But at least it'll be honest. The Dark Knight returns once again -- trimmer, more streamlined, and with a vitality that hasn't been seen since the first years of his war on crime. Together with his army of Bat-soldiers, including Carrie Kelley -- formerly Robin, and now the new Catgirl -- the Dark Knight wages a new war on a diseased world that's become completely lost. But to fight this war successfully, he must first return to being the World's Greatest Detective and discover what has become of his former allies who were once the World's Greatest Heroes. THE DARK KNIGHT STRIKES AGAIN will be told in 3-parts -- each issue a whoppin' 80 pages in Prestige Format -- masterfully written and illustrated by Frank Miller and featuring the magnificent colors of Miller's collaborator, Lynn Varley. Published by DC Comics, 2002. Bagged &amp; Boarded. We have over 25 years comic book experience and grade by Overstreet standards so bid with confidence. NOTE!!! This is a PRE-SELL auction in anticipation of the January 2002 release, and upon its reception will be shipped immediately to you.

    <Description>Magnificent pieces of fabric. Five pieces of fabric in this lot. Sizes: HUGE 109" x 16", 40" x 16", 59" x 16", 53" x 16", and 64" x 16" w/ narrow hem. This lot would work well for curtains, valances or bedskirt, etc. This is one of the Ralph Lauren Estate Collection fabrics. It is the very silky Egyptian Cotton Sateen that is so characteristic of Ralph Lauren. The pattern is Equestrian Paisley. It is predominantly bronze, brown, olive, wine and dark gold. I have tried everything to get this to show up in digital picture or scan to no avail. It is gorgeous. I am always glad to combine multiple purchases to save on s&amp;h. From a non smoking and non pet household. 5.80 s&amp;h. Prefer Pay Pal but do accept money orders and cashiers checks for immediate shipment. Personal checks ship when clear, usually 7-10 days. Payment needs to reach me in 10 days. U.S. bidders only please.</Description>

    <Description>THIS IS A MINT CONDITION COTTON LIGHTWEIGHT SPREAD OR COVERLET THAT IS THE SWEETEST PINK YOU'VE EVER SEEN. IT IS TWIN SIZED AND IS FROM THE 1950'S I BELIEVE. IT IS THE STYLE THAT HAS THE TOP PART THAT FITS THE TOP OF THE BED AND THEN THE SIDES DROP OFF TO THE FLOOR. THE EDGE IS RUFFLED WHERE THE TOP MEETS THE SKIRT BUT THE REST IS REALLY QUITE TAILORED. IT IS SPLIT FOR A 4 POSTER BED. IT IS PALE PINK WITH A SIMPLE AND VERY PRETTY WHITE INSERT THAT HAS PINK AND AN PALE TAUPEY BROWN DESIGN IN FLOWERS AND LEAVES. THE LABEL SAYS MARTEX-CABIN CRAFTS-PERSONAL APPOINTMENTS FOR THE BATH AND BEDROOM. THIS IS A VERY SWEET LITTLE SPREAD AND THE PICTURE DOESN'T DO IT JUSTICE. THE FIRST PICTURE IS THE MORE ACCURATE COLOR WISE. PLEASE E-MAIL ME WITH ANY QUESTIONS. NO RESERVE. BUYER PAYS SHIPPING. I ACCEPT PAY PAL, BID PAY, MO'S AND PERSONAL CHECKS. ITEM IS HELD FOR CHECK CLEARANCE. I WILL EVEN WRAP THIS ITEM FOR X-MAS FOR FREE AND SHIP IT TO THE ADDRESS THAT YOU PREFER IF THAT IS YOUR REQUEST.</Description>

    <Description>I purchased this graniteware / enamelware pitcher with a molded spout in Ireland. The pitcher is white and has gray trim around the rim and on the handle. The enamel is faded and dull and I believe the trim was probably black when it was new (probably many years ago). It appears to be very well made, but there is some rust primarily at the rim of the base, and the bottom - both inside and out. It measures approx. 7" in height; and approx. 6" in diameter at the base. There is no "maker marking" so I am uncertain as to age and origin. Looks great filled either with dried or fresh flowers - a great addition to any collection! Please see photos and email me if you have any questions, thanks!</Description>

    <Description>This auction is for insert card B6 from the Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season 5 trading cards by Inkworks. The card was pulled from a pack and immediately placed in a plastic toploader for its protection. It is in mint condition and will be shipped to you in a toploader to maintain its perfection. This is a great card, and a real must have for the true Buffy and Angel fan and collector. I have tons of other Buffy and Angel cards up on auction, so please take a look if you_re trying to complete your set with inserts and autographed cards! I welcome all bidders, including international, but please read all shipping details before bidding. If you cannot comply with the following terms, please do not bid. The winning bidder will be required to add $1.50 for USPS First Class Shipping within the US. I will combine shipping on multiple card auction wins. US shipping will be combined on multiple cards as follows: $1.50 for the first card + $0.25 for each additional card. International bidders must pay actual shipping costs to their locations. These costs will be determined at the end of the auction. If you_d like to get a shipping estimate for an international location sooner (give me at least 24 hours before the end of auction), please e-mail me with your location. All payments must be received within 10 days of the auction_s end or the item will be relisted and appropriate feedback will be posted. I prefer payment via money order, but I will also accept PayPal if you need your item quickly. If time is not a factor, I ask that the winning bidder please use a money order instead of sending payment via PayPal. Personal checks may be accepted if your feedback rating is 10 or higher with no negatives. Again, if you cannot comply with these terms, please do not bid. Good luck to all you Buffy and Angel fans out there and happy bidding! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>I purchased this vintage graniteware enamel bowl in Ireland. It is white on the outside and blue with a white design on the inside. The rim is trimmed in black. I am uncertain as to age or origin, but it has been used as evidenced by the enamel wear primarily at the rim of the bowl. It is approx. 3 _" high and 10 _" in diameter at the rim. Please see photos and email me if you have any questions, thanks!</Description>

    <Description>Greetings: Offering a wonderful rosebud chenille bedspread measuring 74 by 112 inches excluding fringe...It would cover a twin or you could use it on a full bed with a bedskirt,The fringe is complete..I held it up to the light for careful inspection and I found 2 leaves missing, the rest of the leaves and rosebuds are intact..There is a pinprick hole and a tiny hole smaller than a pencil eraser plus a dime size hole close to the bottom edge near the fringe. It really is vibrant in color and looks very nice considering its age and the washings it has withstood. Would make an impressive gift. Buyer to pay actual postage to be remitted within 10 days of auction close, I take paypal money order or check, Thanks for looking and Happy Holidays!</Description>

I welcome all bidders, including international, but please read all shipping details before bidding. If you cannot comply with the following terms, please do not bid.

What you are Bidding On: #190 TIME MACHINE comic book '60 Rod Taylor Type of Item: Original Vintage Dell Movie Comic Book (measures 7 1/2" x 10") Description: The comic book adaptation of The Time Machine, the classic 1960 George Pal science fiction film (based on the H.G. Wells novel) starring Rod Taylor, Alan Young, and Yvette Mimieux and features artwork by Reynold Brown Condition &amp; Defects: I am not a comic book dealer (although I was a full-time comic book dealer from 1967 to 1976, but the hobby has changed drastically in the past 25 years!). I know nothing about comic book grading, or the terms that are used, but I will do my best to generally accurately and conservatively describe the overall condition of each. I always offer a complete return privilege on everything thing I sell, and this comic book is included! Here is an overview of this comic's condition (see my other eBay sales where I am selling a total of 13 of these comic book adaptations of science fiction films): The comic book is in very good condition.

Our Feedback Policy We only leave feedback on those who leave feedback on us. The reason we leave feedback in this manner is both because we don't consider a transaction "completed" until the buyer has decided they are happy with their purchase, and also because we sell so many items (usually 500+ a week) that it would require an extra employee if we had to leave feedback first, and that would mean raising our prices, which we don't want to do. All but a handful of our 10,000+ customers are understanding on this and are willing to leave feedback first. If you are one of the few people who insist on feedback being left as soon as you make payment, PLEASE DO NOT BID ON ANY OF OUR AUCTIONS. IMPORTANT! Please read our Shipping Terms before you place a bid on this item! U.S. only : Shipping is SEVEN DOLLARS ($7) , (unless the item is oversized, in which case shipping is $12, as would be clearly noted in the description above).

    <Description>You are bidding on DC Presents #21 by DC Comics May 1976. It lays flat and tight with loads of cover gloss. Interior pages are cream colored and supple. This comic contains four complete stories which include Superman battling giant spiders and misquotoes, Green Lantern against the Leap year menace, The Marvel Family battling a monster that triplicates, and humans in a war with prehistoric creatures. It was a NM/M but the former owner had it stacked without protection so it received some front cover indentions, and light soiling pile soiling on the rear cover. Overall it is now a very high F+/VF-. High bidder to pay shipping($2.00 via Media unless Priority is requested then rate will increase) Insurance is 1.10 extra. If you choose to decline insurance and the package arrives damaged or doesn't arrive at all, please understand that you accept that responsibility and have no recourse to obtain a refund. Comic will be shipped well protected &amp; flat, with backing board and bagged, between two heavy pieces of cardboard to protect the condition. If you win multiple auctions, they will be combined to save you shipping cost. Pay Pal is available, otherwise, Money orders or Cashiers checks in U.S. funds please. Personal checks will be held for 10 days prior to shipping any items. Thank You. Check out my other auctions. For those of you that live up to your comitments, ignore the next statement. FOR THOSE WHO THINK THIS IS A GAME(AS TOO MANY HAVE IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS), HEED THE FOLLOWING: IF YOU DO NOT INTEND TO COMPLETE THIS TRANSACTION-DO NOT BID. I AM GETTING TOO OLD TO DEAL WITH THE HASSLE FROM NON PAYING BIDDERS AND THEY CAN EXPECT NEGATIVE FEEDBACK.</Description>

    <Description>Wind-up Walking Shot Glass - Too Cute! "Walking" might be too strong a term for what this shot glass actually does - "Burdened Waddling" would perhaps describe the action better. It does however manage to slowly maneuver (while wobbling from side to side) in a forward direction. I didn't try it "loaded with fuel" and I don't know how far you could expect him to go but judging from the brief tryout I doubt that you could expect more than a couple of feet on one winding. Even with these limitations it's a fun item. It's made from chromed plastic and has an on/off tab switch at the rear near the bottom. He was made in Japan - I don't know how old it is. I will happily combine items to save on shipping. To view our other items on auction this week, click here: View Jeenagal's other Auctions. Lucky High Bidder please contact me ASAP with name, street address, city, state and zip so I can calculate shipping/insurance costs. All items 5lbs and under will be shipped USPS Priority Mail.

    <Description>TENYO Menta-Marvel T-158 in Original Packaging 5 DAY AUCTION In 1992, the effect which is considered by many to be one of Tenyo_s best, Suzuki_s Crystal Cleaver, was released. The same year, Tenyo also released the Menta-Marvel effect. However, unlike a majority of the Tenyo effects from the early 90s that are still in good supply, Menta-Marvel has become very difficult to find. Another interesting aspect of the Menta-Marvel effect is that it retailed for a bit more than other Tenyo items of its time_I believe I paid around $25 or $30 for this. Menta-Marvel was created by Yutaka Sato and is now a discontinued Tenyo item. For those of you not familiar with the Menta-Marvel effect, the back side of the packaging is shown in the picture below and gives a description of the effect. Supplied with the prediction board is a carrying case, a chinese crayon (if necessary, this can be replaced with a similar chinese crayon available at any office supply store), and also a cleverly-constructed set of ESP cards. The packaging has a few creases, the plastic _bubble_ has a couple small cracks and some dirt marks, however the apparatus appears to be in excellent condition. Here_s a chance to pick up what is possibly one of the most difficult post-_T-150_ Tenyo effects to find. If you have any questions about this trick, or if you_re having trouble viewing the images, please feel free to contact me through eBay_s _Ask Seller A Question_ feature. I welcome any questions, but please try to ask questions early, as I may not be able to respond to questions submitted shortly before the auction ends. Before bidding, please take a moment to check out the terms and conditions listed below the pictures. Finally, please note that this is a 5 day auction which will end this Sunday afternoon. Thanks for looking! TERMS AND CONDITIONS: I prefer payment through PayPal, however I also gladly accept payment by money order. No checks, cash, or COD requests please. Winning bidder in the US agrees to pay actual shipping cost of $4.35 for USPS Priority Mail shipping with delivery confirmation. Bidders outside of the US, please ask me for a shipping quote before bidding, and please include your postal code in the inquiry. I_ll contact the winning bidder by email within 24 hours of auction_s end. Winning bidder, please reply to my email as soon as possible. Thanks for checking out my auction. Good luck!</Description>

    <Description>This aluminum child's dish has the abc's around the rim. The plate measures 6" in diameter and is 3/4" deep. There is a separation in 2 places around the rim and a few dents but nothing serious. The cute little aluminum cup has the cow jumping over the moon embossed on one side along with the words "The Cow jumped over the Moon". The other side has "Old Mother Hubbard" and the embossed picture of Mother Hubbard, the cubpoard and her dog. It is missing the handle and has a tiny split near the rim. They are still a very nice pair of vintage child's kitchenware. Shipping charge will be $4.00 in the U.S. I will combine shipping on multiple items. Please view my other auctions.

We carry swing, mod, hippie, rockabilly, lounge, swank, rave, gothic... if you can name it, chances are we've got it! As with all vintage clothes, some wear is to be expected.

Bid with confidence- check our feedback! Feel free to email if you have any questions, we re here to help. And don't forget, kids: T-Bone takes Pay Pal!

US shipping will be $5.00. We can no longer ship any other way than USPS Priority within the US. Priority mail allows for delivery confirmation (which really covers both the seller AND the buyer). Because we must rely on delivery confirmation for verification, we cannot deviate from this policy. This auction is for serious bidders only.

We will remove these negative bidders from our auctions at our discretion. If payment is not received within ten days from end of auction bidders will be given a negative feedback, be reported to eBay as deadbeat bidder and be removed from any of our auctions.

    <Description>This is a FLANNEL replica of the jersey Roy Hobbs wore in Bernard Malamud's classic novel "The Natural". It is an XL and has "Knights" across the chest in sewn-on Navy Blue FELT over an Orange felt background. On the back is Hobbs' famous #9, also in orange over navy felt, just like the old "burlap bags" of the first half century. On the sleeve is a classic lightning patch. This piece is absolutely stunning and would look awesome framed but once you put on baseball flannel, you may never want to take it off! Buyer pays $5 s&amp;h. Good Luck Fellow Malamud fan!!!!!!!!!!

    <Description>Vintage Barkcloth Drapes Scenic Garden 33x44 PAIR OF VINTAGE BARKCLOTH DRAPERY PANELS Scenic Garden Design Description: A magnificent set of pinch-pleated, lined drapery panels from an estate in Pennsylvania. Background is a soft shade of grey with a scenic garden design featuring green and grey leafed, as well as pink blossoming trees, garden statuary and columns. The colors feature several shades of grey, green, pink, with some white accenting. The design shown in the first picture is repeated randomly across the panels. Each panel of this pair measures 33" across the top edge, 67" across the bottom edge, and are 44" in length with a generous 6" hem. They are lined with an ivory fabric, which I believe is probably silk. They are a heavy weight, and are obviously quite well made. The lighting in the first picture shows them to be a bit darker than they actually are; the second photo shows more of the true coloring. Due to the width of the panels there is a lengthwise seam running down each panel. This pair of vintage barkcloth curtains is one of 2 pair of the same design and color that I am listing. U.S. Shipping Cost: $8.50 Please contact me for International Shipping Rates as they are slightly higher. Multiple purchases from my auctions can be combined to save on shipping costs. Condition: These drapes are in excellent condition. They have been well taken care of by the previous owners. There are no stains, holes, or worn spots that I can find. The colors are still bright. The ivory lining (which I believe is silk, but am not guaranteeing) has darked some from age, somewhat more noticeably so in the folds, but I see no evidence of water staining, etc. As with the barkcloth, the lining also does not have any noticeable holes or tears.

    <Description>This fine michelob clock would make a nice decoration in your bar area. It measures about 18 inches tall by ten inches wide. It has a mirrored surface. and requires two aa batteries (not included). The clock is quartz and is manufactured by Stamford. The frame has a small amount of corrosion, and there's a very small amount on the bottom of the mirror as well as slight corrosion on the hands, but none of it is too noticable from afar. Hands are slightly loose and slip occasionally. Should be able to be fixed easily by tightening. I accept billpoint, cashiers checks, and money orders. Sorry, no personal checks or paypal.

    <Description>This darling vintage "Sally Strawberry" tea towel would make a great gift for the tea towel collector, for someone named "Sally", or for the strawberry fan. I believe it is made from cotton, and it measures 21" wide by 37" tall when fully opened. It has a wonderful strawberry person embroidered on it, along with the name "Sally Strawberry". Her strawberry head is a purple material, and her features, including long eyelashes and red lips, have been embroidered on. She has little embroidered legs with high heel shoes, and is kicking up her heels. The bottom front of the towel has black embroidery. This tea towel is in beautiful condition with only one very small little catch, or hole, on the front side. I am also listing a darling "Betty Pear" tea towel this evening. This is being listed with no reserve, but to be fair to all bidders, seller reserves the right to void this auction if the E-Bay system goes down within one hour of the closing of this auction. Successful bidder pays priority mail postage and insurance. Seller accepts payments by Paypal, check or money order. If payment is made by personal check, item will be held until check clears.

    <Description>100 Magic: the Gathering Cards (Beta - Recent) (Type "www.jpcompany.net" into your browser for more information.) I don't know very much about these cards. A guy who was quitting magic sold them to me cheap. I have looked through them for about 15 minutes, and I have seen Beta, Legends, Arabian Nights, Antiquities, Fallen Empire, Ice Age, Mirage, Visions, Alliances, Revised , and many other cards. The seller said that he has been collecting for a long time. I am selling these cards 100 at a time because it is easier than selling them individually. I will only ship cards that are in excellent to very good condition and no basic lands. If you have any questions feel free to email me. Feel free to send any questions you have to johnpapp@prodigy.net . Buyer pays $4.00 shipping and handling. Buyer can pay with a credit card using Paypal, money order, or personal check. For over a year, we have built our reputation on auctions exactly like this one . Our customers come back again and again to purchase Magic: the Gathering Cards for far cheaper than retailers sell booster packs. If you are afraid to bid because you think that these might be bad cards that I am trying to get rid of, just email some of the people who have left me feedback for a "100 magic cards" auction. Here are some examples of feedback left for these auctions: User !!Dragon!! said about item 1143998201 (a "100 Magic Cards" auction), "Great cards!! second set bought from U...better than first!! A++!!! thanks...." User Saiyanech said about item 1153639356 (a "100 Magic Cards" auction), "Good Cards, 8 rares, and an Aladdin from Arabian Nights. Thanks" User MrLavadour@yahoo.com said about item 1140872136 (a "100 Magic Cards" auction), "I am very glad I took this bid, great selection of cards and rares AAA+++" User Angelfiero said about item 1142221226 (a "100 Magic Cards" auction), "AWESOME SERVICE!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS GUYS PREPACK!! WORTH THE MONEY" User Darkjediapprentice said about time 539817149 (a "100 Magic Cards" auction), "Great lot of cards!!! I VERY highly recommend John as a seller!!A+++++++++++++" There are many more similar comments in my feedback if you want even more proof that this is a quality buy. I would like all potential bidders to note that although these are quality cards, all of them are definitely not beta, and you are not guaranteed Beta cards in every group of 100. Also, there are foreign cards mixed in so I do not want any complaints about receiving foreign cards. We have many other auctions currently running that are exactly like this one. Check them out at Current JP Auctions . I guarantee that you will find at least one lot of 100 cards without any bids.

Email me any of your questions not specifically addressed in my description......reddog1988@aol.com I want my bidders/customers to know that you can purchase my items with the utmost confidence. I have been a Depression Glass and American Art Pottery collector for 25 years. You can be assured that the item that you are bidding on will be as I have described it. My honesty is impeccable, and my feedback speaks for itself. As a collector, who has made many purchases on eBay, I know the heartache of dealing with sellers that have no business selling glassware, china, and pottery. Their incompetence in describing and packaging their items can really become problematic for the serious collector trying to make a purchase for their collections. PLEASE be assured that your transaction with me will be a GREAT experience. I can accept money orders and checks as valid means of payment. The winning bidder should expect to pay $5 towards the cost of three day priority shipping. The cost of insurance will be determined after the auction's closing. Customers using the BUY IT NOW option will receive FREE insurance. Payment MUST be received within 10 days of being contacted by me. All of my items on eBay are 100% GUARANTEED to be as described. Due to family commitments, on occasion I may be called out of town for a few days. I_ll answer emails immediately upon my return, so please don_t panic if you don_t hear from me right away. Due to the increased instability of the eBay site, it may be a wise decision to bookmark this auction if you are interested in bidding upon it. Recently, the MY EBAY and SEARCH functions have not been working properly on eBay, and my customers have been unable to find previously viewed items. Paul's Sweet Cherry Brandy 5-21-88 to 8-26-00.

    <Description>This 14 inch by 21 inch neon sign has Marlboro with a cigarette going thru the name and smoke coming off the cigarette. Marlboro is written in black and the cigarette and smoke are white and the butt is yellow. I can't tell you what color it lights up as because it is still in the plastic. It comes with the plug and cord. The back is exposed, so there might be a couple scratches but nothing major, but other than that it is in EXCELLENT condition. I am selling it at a great price and it would be a great item to add to your bar or collection....also a great gift idea! Buyer pays actual shipping cost, no handling fee. Please note that shipping outside the USA can be costly. Thanks for looking and please see my other auctions for great gift ideas! Happy Ebaying! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

You can save a bunch on shipping by buying several shirts, since they are so light. I can ship up to 6 shirts for $3.95! Shipping for this shirt will be $3.50 priority mail. Insurance against loss or damage by the post office is optional and costs an additional $1.10. I will ship within 2 business days of receiving your payment.

Keep checking back throughout December for more additions! General policies: I will gladly combine shipping and insurance costs on auctions ending within 10 days of each other.

    <Description>Benning - Condrey Drug Company Fort Smith, Ark Bottle Benning - Condrey Drug Company was in business for many years at 421 Garrison Avenue in Fort Smith, Arkansas. There were several drug companies in that part of town and visitors coming over the bridge from Oklahoma used to be greeted by a very large sign advertising laxatives...which made me wonder just what people thought of my hometown. Other than that I know nothing about this bottle. It is an unusual size I've been told, it is 2 and 7/16th inches wide by 7 and 1/4 inches tall. It has a measuring rule in the glass on either side, one is in CC's and the other I'm guessing is ounces and if I'm right this bottle held 8 ounces of something that I bet made you sleep real well at night......funny how the whiskey warehouses and the drug companies were side by side in old Fort Smith. The bottle is in good condition with a couple of little chips...the worst can be seen in the 3rd scan below. It comes with dirt and stains still inside from being buried for years. But the bottle would still hold 8 oz of Dr. Kick'em Up if you had a cork to keep the juice inside. The lettering is very sharp on this bottle and its a miracle it's still around. Arm yourselves, and be ye men of valour, and be in readiness for the conflict; for it is better for us to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation and our altar......

Color front and back is outstanding...Front cover by Keith Pollard and Doug Herrings original version of Thor. Back cover Dave Cockrums original character model sheet of El Aguila. Comic is in Exc shape. No..binding dimples, binding corners are great..no paper loss.or bumping but just a pencil point size color loss on very tips. edges are sharp and clean . Opening corners ars Excellent. Front cover has a very light indentation from what looks to be where someone may have stacked another book on top of it in a of set direction. This is new and may flatten out with time..It is only on the cover page and does not go through. 62 pages long The pages in this are an off white..Now I think they may have been this color when printed..or close to a newspaper color..I say this becasue when you turn into the book there are some very white pages see the last 2 pics for the comparison...If they were all white to start with...They would all yellow at the same rate of time and be very close to the same color as each other..Its amazing that this held up as well as it did..Considering the fragile nature of the grade of paper used for the cover...It is not much above a newspaper stock..Not to mention how well the color held up. The art work front and back and the condition of it are amazing..I love the way it re-creates an old style look and feel. I do not think anyone will be dissapointed with this issue.

The inside front cover shows chocolate sweets and says "Chocolate-brown sweets for the man in the house..." Each category has advertisements on products Jewel Tea carried and the center has a colored picture of some products saying "Take the drudgery out of housework by using Jewel's cleaning aids." I remember the Jewel Tea man coming to our house when I was a Kid (now I'm telling my age) This book has 62 pages. It is 5 1/2" x 8". It has no missing pages and is not coming apart. As you can tell by the pic's it must have been used as it has some foxing. I like the recipe for Fried Spring Chicken. I wonder when we quit using the term "Spring Chicken"? Also, with this is a Silverware coupon from Jewel Tea Co which expired on Dec. 31, 1951. THANKS FOR LOOKING AND GOOD LUCK BIDDING. No reserve.</Description>
