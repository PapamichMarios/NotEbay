    <Description>This is a beautiful white satin romper suit in size 6-12 month or 13-19 pounds. Comes with a soft batiste-type fabric undergarment that is open on the sides, embroidered satin vest and cap and little stockings. This outfit has been used once and then professionally cleaned and heirloom packaged (just like a wedding gown). I have broken the seal &amp; removed it from its blue tissue paper just to take these photos. All items are in excellent condition with the exception of the cap which has a rust-type looking stain on the back - (see photo).Great outfit for any little boy or would be nice for the doll collector needing an outfit for that special little boy doll.</Description>

It is brown and tan striped with brick red striping around the middle of the sweater. There are no holes, stains or rips here either.

    <Description>Girls 3 Pc Shirt Lot 3T/Baby Gap, TCP, Disney Here are three shirts for your little girl. First, is a pink tie-dye shirt by The Children's Place. As with any tie-dye, there are imperfections in the color, it's supposed to be that way. The shirt is long-sleeve and in very good condition with snaps at one shoulder. Second is a Minnie Mouse shirt by Disney's Micky &amp; Co. line. It is actually size 2T, but is about the same size as the other two. It is a really cute shirt in VERY good condition. Last is a white Baby Gap shirt. On the front, ice skates are sewn on and there is a lace trim at the neckline. This shirt could stand to be bleached. There is a small spot on the front bottom (you may be able to see it in the pic). It is also in good condition.

    <Description>The HOTTEST Gucci bag on eBay! Unfortunately, there is a lot of fake Gucci on ebay. This bag is not one of them. How can you tell the difference? The name _Gucci_ should be engraved on all metal hardware including snaps, buckles and metal handle attachments. There should also be a Gucci serial code under the leather label on the interior. Fabric and leather should be solid, durable, and of the highest quality. An eBay description which says the bag has a Gucci label but fails to say it is authentic is a warning sign that it might be a counterfeit item. Whether or not you decide to buy here, beware of any auction or seller who cannot guarantee authenticity! The quality of the fakes is not nearly the same as the real thing. There are few fashion designers who have been as influential as Gucci. They have remained at the very top of the fashion world for decades, and consistently set the pace for the rest of the pack. This 100% authentic Gucci purse shows why many fashion aficionados are willing to spend a few week_s salary to own a Gucci item. It is made of jet black fabric subtly embossed with Gucci_s famous crossed _GG_ logo. It is trimmed and detailed with black leather, and has a single black leather strap in that in-between size that lets you choose between wearing it off your shoulder or carrying it as a tote. The roomy interior has a single internal zippered compartment, and the bag snaps sharply shut via an internal magnetic strap Absolutely fabulous! The bag measures 11.5" inches accross the bottom tapering up to 9.5" at the top. It stands 10" tall, and the strap measures 22" long including the hardware. _Gucci, Made in Italy_ is engraved in the handsome silver metal attachments which hold the strap, on the magnetic snap which closes the bag, and on the leather tag on the interior. There is a Gucci serial number under the tag. _Gucci_ is also embossed on the leather zipper pull which closes the internal compartment. This 100% authentic bag is direct from Saks Fifth Avenue, where it was used briefly as display model on a mannequin. It is in brand new condition and has never been worn. This fabulous bag retails for over $550. With a $10 starting bid and no reserve, this is a real steal that you don_t want to miss! Direct from Saks Fifth Avenue to you for a fraction of the cost! Each month I list dozens of shoes, bags and accessories that were used briefly as floor models or were returns to Saks Fifth Avenue. These items have little or no wear. They are all guaranteed authentic, and are all from the very top designers. Some still have the original Saks labels on them. Unless otherwise mentioned, they do not come with boxes or dust bags. None were originally priced lower than $150, some sell for more than $600. Most of my auctions will begin below $50 with NO RESERVE. I put up new items all the time, so check my auctions frequently, and most of all, HAVE FUN! MY TERMS: Domestic shipping/handling for this item will be $6.00. International shipping rates will vary. All purchases must be paid for in US dollars. I cannot accept returns on clothing or shoes. I am not responsible if a shoe does not fit. I list the brand and the size and it is your responsibility to know if you can wear this brand in this size. I am happy to provide any measurements you request before you bid.

    <Description>This is a pair of pajamas for a little boy, though I would imagine it would be fine for a girl as well. The top is a tee shirt, with Pooh in the center, and the sleeves are grey with mini-Poohs,peeking at a green worm and the word Hello repeated through out. The bottoms are boxer shorts, the same pattern as the sleeves. Both pieces are made of 100% polyester, very soft, light material. These PJ's have gotten quite a bit of use, and are a bit worn (colors slightly faded, a little bit of pilling) The shirt has a few dingy areas, only one is visible on the front (yellowed). But there are no stains or rips, and there is definitely a lot of life left in this set! All clothes that I sell do come from a household with both smoking and pets. But all clothes are stored in closets, most in plastic garment bags and they are freshly laundered upon sale. If you check my feedback comments, you will see that I always try to describe my items honestly and accurately. Be sure to check out my other auctions for more unique clothing items. High Bidder to pay $3.50 for Priority Shipping. Insurance is $1.10 extra, if requested. International buyers, please email me your country for actual shipping cost.

    <Description>Brand new. Never worn. Perfect condition. Size L. Colors are 3 shades of blue. Incredible looking. A great basic piece to wear as a layer or by itself. Sharp! Smoke-free/ pet-free home. I won't sell anything I wouldn't consider good enough to buy for myself. My clothes are in great shape. Check out my other auctions. I basically list women's, maternity, children's, and infant clothing (new and gently used). And . . . I try to list a group of items at least once a week, so you never know what you will find! Keep checking back. My children and I have waaaaaay too many clothes. I guess that's what happens when Mommy and Mema like to shop so much! My husband better watch out - I'm going into his closet next! Buyer to pay $3.50 for shipping. Insurance is $1.10 extra and optional. Delivery confirmation is $.40 extra and optional as well. I accept (and prefer) Paypal but will take personal checks with 30+ positive feedbacks. Money orders are always welcome if sent promptly - i.e. I should get it within a week. Regardless of method of payment, it MUST be received within 7 days of close of auction. Please do not bid if you are not prepared to pay</Description>

    <Description>HOT WHEELS SHIFT KICKERS 'COOKIN' CAPRI' - MIP It seems every year Hot Wheels would introduce a new series of cars and trucks with the latest gimmick for those who wanted something more than a regular die cast car. This week I've got a few examples of these models. This auction is for a Shift Kicker 'Cookin' Capri'. This one is mint in it's original package. It's based on an early 80s Mercury Capri. It was made in Hong Kong. There is a stick shift sticking out the rear window. As it says on the package 'Rev it up! Pop it in gear! Watch it peel out!' An interesting addition to your collection from around 1982/83. Die-cast metal with rubber Goodyear racing tires, it measures about 3 inches long. Please see the photo above. I'll be glad to answer any E-questions you have but please get them in early as I am not always online as the auctions are ending. The lucky bidder agrees to pay within 10 days and to include $3.50 for Priority Post. I will contact you within 24 hours after the auctions close, please ignore any references to Checkout inserted by Ebay. There are no additional shipping and handling charges. Insurance is optional but recommended, the reponsibility is up to you. Foreign bidders that can use Bid-Pay or Pay-Pal are invited. Everything else is just taking way too long . Foreign shipments can go by either uninsured regular Air Mail or insured Global Express, we'll discuss the actual charges once I know where it is going. Accepted payments are by US$ Money Orders, BID-PAY or PAY-PAL. All assure next day shipping. Please check out my other auctions for more interesting Hot Wheel diecasts. I am always happy to merge multiple wins to save on shipping. Good Luck, bid early and thanks for stopping by.

    <Description>This is another one of my favorite outfits that my daughter wore. It is a size 12/18 month Tommy Hilfiger polo style dress. It is pink with navy and white stipes. The collar is white with navy trimming. The Hilfiger logo is on the chest with three gold buttons (also with the Hilfiger logo) going up the front. This dress is in very good condition, but I just noticed some faint spots near the logo wear some of the color may have bled. I tried to capture it in the second picture, but I don't even think you can see it, the marks are very light, but I thought I should mention them. Other than that, it is a great dress. Winning bidder chooses to pay either first class shipping of $1.30 or priority for $3.50. Shipping to Canada may be more. I accept personal checks (must clear), money orders, and Paypal (no credit cards). I do NOT accept Billpoint for this item. Item comes from a pet/smoke free home. Due to a recent growth spurt, I have been cleaning out my daughter's closet and will be listing several items in the 6-18 month category. Thanks for looking!

    <Description>Here is a cool pair of jet black suede or roughout cowboy boots in a size 10.5. I'm assuming the width is EE because they are a little too loose for me. The numbers printed inside the boots are 105 3 378. There is a label inside the shafts that say "LA # 1 Billy Boots". The shafts have 4 rows of subtle stitching. The bull-doggin' heels are 2 inches high and have "Billy Boots-Handmade" imprinted on their bottoms. The toes are pointed with the soles squared at the tips, there is a stitched "toe-bug" on the tops. The soles and heels are in like new condition, looks like they were worn maybe 4 times. The boot is all leather, except for the lining of the foot, which is a fleece/flannel material; because of this, I think this would make a GREAT boot for the Winter months. There are a few minor cosmetic problems with these boots: Firstly, there are a few minor cracks in the piping that goes up the sides of the boots-nothing that a black marker wouldn't fix. Secondly, there is a minor stain above the heel area on the right boot-NOT driver rub, the leather on these is in good condition. Overall, a really HOT looking pair of winter kickers. If you have any questions, please e-mail me before you bid, as sale is final. Buyer to pay actual shipping (@$10 to USA). I ONLY accept USPS money-orders or BidPay &amp; payment must be made within 7 days of auction end. THANKS FOR LOOKING!!!</Description>

    <Description>My auction entries may be lacking in frills, but at least they're no-nonsense! THE ITEM : A long-sleeve shirt, just in time for winter! Read on: MAKER: Polo NEW/USED: Barely and lovingly used. SIZE: 17.5x35 CONDITION: Like new! SPECIAL NOTE: Has NOT been in storage with the rest, and is odor free and freshly-pressed! SHIPPING: $3.95 for USPS Priority Mail. Note that this is the price of the postage - people that charge a little extra for "handling" need to be slapped. Items are (usually) shipped crammed in a USPS bag/envelope, and I'll GLEEFULLY combine orders to save you on shipping costs! I will (reluctantly) send items parcel post or to Canada; in such a situation, the actual rate will be determined by the good people of the US Post Office. PAYMENT: PayPal is always preferred, but I'll accept money orders, checks, cash, bars of gold, your first born, whatever ya' got. Further payment information will be included in the email you'll receive from me within 24 hours of the auction's end--in other words, you don't really need to do the "Checkout" thing, as I'll contact you as soon as I'm able! THE FINE PRINT: All of my merchandise is guaranteed - if an item doesn't meet your standards, I'll gladly refund your payment (except shippings costs) as soon as I receive the item back. If you have any questions, feel free to email MrPantless@aol.com . Thanks! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>This is another really super licensed t-shirt, based on the J.K. Rowling Harry Potter books (I have many more styles and sizes of shirts listed this week)...what a super surprise for Christmas! It is boy's size Large/L or 12/14, but it would be appropriate for a BOY OR GIRL, and younger children could wear it as a baggy shirt or sleep shirt, as well. It is a comfortable 100% cotton, navy blue (a rich, dark shade like midnight blue) with a really neat 3-D design of the word 'Quidditch' in gold lightning lettering, with gold stars above the I's in 'Quidditch'. The letters are lightly shadowed, giving them a deeper 3-D effect. On the left side there is a matching lightning bolt design with the name 'Harry Potter' at the tip. The details and colors of this shirt are terrific, and your Harry Potter fan will feel like a Quidditch star wearing it! All of the Harry shirts I have listed have some growing room in them as they tend to run a bit large. Kids love Harry Potter, and they'll love this shirt! It would be a super surprise for any occasion. Like all of my items this is brand new with original tags (these come with a Harry Potter bookmark tag) and from a nonsmoking home. Winning bidder pays s/h of 2.75 by first class mail (please be aware that this method will not likely arrive in time for Christmas) or 4.00 by priority mail, insurance extra if desired. I will ship anywhere in the U.S. Payment by money order, cashier's check or Visa/Mastercard through PayPal. PAYPAL AND PRIORITY MAIL GUARANTEES SPEEDIEST DELIVERY FOR THE HOLIDAYS! NO PERSONAL CHECKS. Payment due within 10 days of auction end. DO NOT BID UNLESS YOU ARE A RESPONSIBLE, PROMPT PAYER...NONPAYING BIDDERS WILL BE REPORTED TO EBAY AND APPROPRIATE FEEDBACK WILL BE LEFT. NO BIDDERS WITH NEGATIVE FEEDBACK RECORDS. Please visit my other auctions---I will be listing many more clothing and educational items for children this week, including LOTS MORE HARRY POTTER GOODIES (more clothing and accessories, bedding, bath/beach towels, Legos and more), and other favorite children's characters and brands. I will happily combine shipping. Courteous and responsible bidders only, please. Thanks so much and God Bless!</Description>

    <Description>deweyt4x3 Package of 100+ Vibrantly Colored 3-4mm Czech glass beads! These bright, shiny beads measure 4mm on the side with the hole, and 3mm as-strung (sort of a "chubby donut" shape). They're small enough for accent beads, but are so richly colored that they can easily make a statement of their own. Excellent for bracelets! I like to use several different colors (see my other auctions) and alternate the beads. The result is a bracelet that's both cost-effective and pretty! :-) The package contains approximately 100+ beads -- usually more as I tend to scoop generously! ;-) I have lots of other beads and goodies listed as well, so please check my other auctions too! :-) Product Images and Text Copyright 1998-2001 by DeweyT.

N/R! Click image to view larger version Click image to view larger version Pictured is a NEAT belt buckle in the shape of a Hand grenade! This is done in a relief design and has raised detail. It is nice quality and weighs about 6-8 ozs. It is a white metal and my magnet will not stick to any part of it except the hook and belt loop on the back. The magnet sticks to them both. The back is marked: "@INSTYLE 1979" and the number "R2001". I purchased a collection of belt buckles a year or so ago and decided to put them up for sale, as my hubby has his "favorite" and will never wear these! I have shown a photo of both sides of the buckle, but my old digital camera is not very good on close-ups. It measures 3 1/4" wide by 2 1/4" tall. If you collect Military memorabilia, belt buckles or just looking for something for that hard to buy for person, this is it! Shipping will be by priority mail and run $3.50. As always, I thank you for viewing my item and wish you good luck! Winner pays actual priority shipping charges. Money order, cashier check and Pay Pal ship the same day as payment is received, unless received on a weekend, then it will ship the following Monday. (Our mail arrives after our Post Office closes at noon on Saturday.) Check shipment is held until check clears the bank. TN res. add 8 1/4% sales tax.

    <Description>These sharp leather shoes by Beliza are blk patent leather and 2 inch heel! Shiny! 5 M I sell some new shoes (if described) but mostly gently used, good quality shoes! Though some of my shoes are completely unworn, I do not have original boxes. If the uppers of my shoes do not rate at least an 8 on a scale of 10 in my opinion, it does not make my Ebay auction unless I absolutely state otherwise in the description! Other than the normal scuff on the underside of the shoe that happens in no time at all from being worn outside, the visible, upper tops of my shoes must be very eye-pleasing with no bad flaws or outrageously major scuffs or ugly stains! What I want is for you to be delighted when you see your shoes, not disappointed! Since shipping cost is always a factor on Ebay, look at all of my shoe auctions and see if you might like some others and save on combined shipping if you bid and win any other shoes from my other auctions. PLEASE NOTE: I need to receive payment within 10 days of auction closing or item will be relisted due to inventory control issues. I can make exceptions if I at least hear from you within 5 days telling me what is going on! If you are mailing in a payment, please let me know within 5 days of auction closing that you are. Thank you! Buyer is to pay $5.00 for domestic priority shipping and handling in the USA for 1 or 2 pairs. Regular boots (not ankle boots) are $6.00 shipping. Extra shipping for more than 2 pairs will be $1.00 per pair. Canada shipping is $7.00 For other international shipping rates, I would prefer a $15 deposit and will refund you the difference because half the time I give someone a rate from the USPS website, it is different when I get the Post Office! I usually ship Mondays and Thursdays since I live rather far from the post office. Optional insurance is $1.10 for up to $50.00. If you are new to Ebay, you can pay online with a credit card through Paypal (my preference), but I can accept Billpoint, check or money order. After the auction, winning bidder will get an automatic notice from Paypal and my mailing address will be on that notice! Thanks for looking and God bless! My Guarantee: If you are not happy with your shoes from my auctions for any reason, I will refund 100% of your money minus shipping for up to 30 days from the close of the auction! Yes, I know well enough that you would be investing in shipping coming and going, but it is something to think about if the bidding gets to a higher level!</Description>

    <Description>Sporty Polo-Ray sunglasses. Frames are composed of optical quality nickel-silver. Lenses offer maximum UVA and UVB protection and really cut the glare (especially when driving). The frames are available in flat black or shiny black only. THE SILVER-TONE FRAME PICTURED IS NOT AVAILABLE! Shipping is only $2.50 no matter how many you buy! Polo-Ray sunglasses are top quality and sell for $20-$30 dollars in stores. This represents a huge mark up. As the premier Polo-Ray seller on e-Bay, I offer them at wholesale prices! Why pay big bucks for "big names" when you can squish or lose them? I rarely have a customer fail to purchase once they see the quality. I accept Paypal(preferred), Billpoint, Cashier check or money order. Depending on your feedback profile, I may accept a personal check. If you want to pay with a personal check, get my OK BEFORE you bid. Visit my store for other awesome deals on great sunglasses. Don't forget to check the MONTHLY SPECIAL!</Description>

    <Description>These shoes by Naturalizer are black leather uppers and woven leather toe area for that extra ooomph! 8.5 W I sell some new shoes (if described) but mostly gently used, good quality shoes! Though some of my shoes are completely unworn, I do not have original boxes. If the uppers of my shoes do not rate at least an 8 on a scale of 10 in my opinion, it does not make my Ebay auction unless I absolutely state otherwise in the description! Other than the normal scuff on the underside of the shoe that happens in no time at all from being worn outside, the visible, upper tops of my shoes must be very eye-pleasing with no bad flaws or outrageously major scuffs or ugly stains! What I want is for you to be delighted when you see your shoes, not disappointed! Since shipping cost is always a factor on Ebay, look at all of my shoe auctions and see if you might like some others and save on combined shipping if you bid and win any other shoes from my other aucti! ons. PLEASE NOTE: I need to receive payment within 10 days of auction closing or item will be relisted due to inventory control issues. I can make exceptions if I at least hear from you within 5 days telling me what is going on! If you are mailing in a payment, please let me know within 5 days of auction closing that you are. Thank you! Buyer is to pay $5.00 for domestic priority shipping and handling in the USA for 1 or 2 pairs. Regular boots (not ankle boots) are $6.00 shipping. Extra shipping for more than 2 pairs will be $1.00 per pair. Canada shipping is $7.00 For other international shipping rates, I would prefer a $15 deposit and will refund you the difference because half the time I give someone a rate from the USPS website, it is different when I get to the Post Office often and usually in your favor! I usually ship Mondays and Thursdays since I live rather far from the post office. Optional insurance is $1.10 for up to $50.00. If you are new to Ebay, you can pay online with a credit card through Paypal (my preference), but I can accept Billpoint, check or money order. After the auction, winning bidder will get an automatic notice from Paypal and my mailing address will be on that notice! Thanks for looking and God bless! My Guarantee: If you are not happy with your shoes from my auctions for any reason, I will refund 100% of your money minus shipping for up to 30 days from the close of the auction! Yes, I know well enough that you would be investing in shipping coming and going, but it is something to think about if the bidding gets to a higher level!</Description>

    <Description>CANON EF 35-70mm 3 Size: 8 Brand: Rush Hour Express Upper: Black Patent with Gold-tone adornments Heel: 3 1/2" Sole: Synthetic Condition: New-Never worn Defects: None Other: A Picture Says a Thousand Words, Doesn_t It? PLEASE READ: If you love high-fashioned heels, then do I have the auctions for you . Over the next few weeks I will be parting with most of my gorgeous high-heel collection. I presently have over 500 pair of the most gorgeous high-heeled shoes that can be found anywhere. You see during the 80_s and early 90_s I was a sought after model and performer, and if I saw a style of shoe that I really liked, I would buy 1 in every color made. So many of the shoes will be available in m a n y c o l o r s . My foot had gotten a little larger as a progressed through my 20_s so many shoes will be size from size 8 to 9.5 (most being 8.5 and 9_s).Most were NEVER EVEN WORN? Brand Names include "W*ld Pair", "Pr*xy", "9-W*st","C*ndies","S*cha London", "Pr*vate Collection", "Sp*nish Leather", "P*lizzio", "J*zz", "Pr*via", "All*re", "K*rin Morgan" ,"M*inframe", "C*lvin Klein", "SR*", "Ch*ndlers","Fr*dericks of Hollyw**d", "Car*ssa", "Sergi* V*lente", "B*re Traps", "Vict*ria_s S*cret", "Z*diak", "Ann* Kl*in II" and many others. It breaks my heart to part with these lovely shoes. But they don_t fit me now, and I don_t foresee my foot getting any smaller in the future. ( thanks to my lovely 17 year old foot models Lisa T (cassidy), Michelle (roche), and Sarah (the princess) who without their help would never have gotten these all on Ebay) Please watch all my auctions over the next several weeks (click on " view seller_s other auctions ") under my Ebay ID at the top of this page. I pulled some of the shoes that were either "Extreme" or "Holiday Fashion" so that they could be bought in time for the Holidays. After that I will auction my "Fall/Winter" collection and finally my "Spring/Summer" (watch for my collection of C*ndies vintage slides in about 8 different colors) Some of the auctions will show several shoes (same style/different colors)- winning bidder will get to choose their color- If they want MORE than 1 color or ALL the colors, please let me know at auction end so that we make work out a special price for additional color(s). I want you to be COMPLETELY satisfied with your purchase. I have FLAWLESS FEEDBACK and am determined to keep it that way. I want repeat and multiple purchase customers. I will work with you on additional pairs for price/shipping. I am not interested in gouging you on add_l shipping _ If I can fit them in the box and it doesn_t cost ME anymore- It won_t cost YOU anymore. I will try to accurately describe each pair in terms of construction/condition. The last thing I want is a disappointed customer _ Shipping with Delivery Confirmation is $5 add $1 for Insurance (recommended) Payment via PayPal (sapone@lm.com) , Billpoint (ten_toes) or Money Order. _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>I cannot accept credit cards or debit cards over PAYPAL NIKE Men's 13 Shoes DESCRIPTION The picture does a good job of showing these shoes. Make no mistake about it, they are not new, they have been used! BUT, they have many more days left in them as the picture shows. Treads are in good shape, the NIKE Swooshk is splashed all over, and you can still read the NIKE LOGO in the inside sole, pictured in the bottom right side of the picture. I have had several folks ask me about the picture, which I forgot to add, and I do aplogize. Since shipping si so high for these "BIG" shoes, I will start the bidding off low, but please relaize that shipping is $6.01, and I cannot accept payment with credit or debit cards over paypal. Money orders, or paypal cash only, see the terms... Review my feedback and bid with confidence or BUY NOW, lock in those savings. Please Read Terms I cannot accept credit cards over PAYPAL Terms PLEASE: NO CREDIT CARDS Initial contact should be made within 3 days I travel! I ship when I can usually Saturday or Monday! Correspondence may be delayed a few days when I_m gone, otherwise, I tend to communicate within 48 hours. Money order, CASH, or Paypal (NO CREDIT CARDS) gladly accepted. Paypal will return your credit card payment! This adds a couple extra days onto time that I can ship to you. Good Checks will also be accepted if feedback is clean and greater than 15 BUT, charges for returned checks are clearly the buyers responsibility.. Payment requested within 10 days. After 10 days, I may start the eBay NON-Payment process. IMPORTANT : I will offer feedback upon completion of the auction. They buyer is obligated to offer feedback under the terms of the auction!

    <Description>FLORAL JUMPER BY LAURA ASHLEY SIZE: 4T (22.5 inches long) MATERIAL: 100% cotton CARE: Machine-Washable DESCRIPTION: Beautiful periwinkle blue floral jumper by Laura Ashley. Brand new with tags. The tag says this is a 5T, however, it fits like a 4. My daughter wears size 4, and it fits her perfectly. However, she refuses to wear a jumper (?!!) so my loss is your gain. It is a "suede-like," "velvet-like" material. Very soft and pretty. TERMS: 1. Winning bidder agrees to pay $3.95 priority shipping. 2. I accept Paypal, Cashiers Check or Money Order. No personal checks. Payment to be made within 10 days or I reserve the right to re-list. 3. If you have any questions, please email me at scand@stratos.net.</Description>

    <Description>Brand new on card, Pink Fuzzy Princess slippers, little girls medium, size 7 1/2- 8 1/2. "Princess" and the crown is embroidred on the front and although in the picture you can't see some of it on one of the slippers, it's just the light. It's all there and perfect. Great for your little Princess! For your peace of mind, I want you to know that all of my packages are taken personally by me to the main Central NJ postal depot, Camp Kilmer in Edison. They are shipped out directly from there and do not go through any other local postal stations or depots, including Trenton or Princeton, where the problems were. Remember the holidays, they aren't THAT far away!!! This, like all new items I sell are FIRSTS . I never deal in seconds or factory rejects. Smoke and pet free environment. Bidding starts low with no reserve. High bidder pays bid plus $3.50 for US shipping . Outside US will be charged ACTUAL shipping with no surcharges. Money order or PayPal ships same or next day, check in 10. Speaking of checks, please check out my other auctions. I will gladly combine shipments to save you $$$ on postage, even if the auctions do not end the same day, or even the same week! Also check out my feedback and bid with confidence. I do thank you for stopping by, and invite you to stop back often, as I list new items 5 times a week. You never know what you might find, and can't possibly live without (grin). Do have fun and good luck bidding!!! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>This is a lot of 19 ties, varying in width, length, style, fabric and designer. See both pictures. Included are a Tergal 2 Mosk's For Men, Houston, 1 by Damon; 1 Monsieur Cravatieur; 1 Oscar de la Renta; 1 Wembley; 2 Oleg Cassini by Burma. Fabrics include rayon, acetate, polyester and dacron on the ones that have tags. Any tie I didn't mention the name of above does not have a tag. All are in Very Very Good to Excellent shape. I don't know anything about ties but many of these measure 57" in length if that helps. These could be good for a lot of things, including those nice skirts I see now and then made exclusively from ties. Mainly though, I would just guess that any man who dresses nicely would be interested in this collection. Weigh altogether a little over 2 pounds. Buyer to pay $5.20 for priority postage. Prefer PayPal or money order but will accept a personal check which must clear before I mail. Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>.titledata { font-family: verdana, sans-serif; font-size:17px; color:#00000; font-weight : bold; } .description { font-family: verdana, sans-serif; color:#636145; background-color : #ffffff; } .link { font-family: verdana, sans-serif; font-size:12px; underline; } HR { color: #000000; } Cowboy's Aussie NADS double-size 12oz Nad's Nad's is the best hair removal system ever, it is the most gentle for sensitive areas, just read the complete ingredients list: Honey - molasses - fruit sugar - vinegar - lemon juice - water - alcohol - food dye -- That's it!! Why use those harsh chemical type hair removal sprays such as Epil-stop, when Nad's is so gentle! Nads is a completely natural, water-soluble hair removal product that looks like green toffee and can be used anywhere on the body. Nad's does not need to be heated. You just smooth on the gel and remove it with linen strips. What you get in the kit: brand new, factory sealed, double-size 12 oz. jar of NADS applicator spatula 5 reusable linen strips instructions This much NADS would cost $37.90 delivered from the NADS website www.nads.com or on TV and takes about 3 weeks to get shipped, whereas I am starting this auction at $1 and will ship the day after the auction ends. Click here for another super cowboy deal on Nicorette gum! Shipping options are as follows: Express shipping - Payment by Paypal, order shipped via Priority Mail within 1 business day of payment, insured - $6.50 Standard shipping - Payment by US post office money order (available for 90 cents at any post office) order shipped via Priority Mail within 1 day of arrival of your payment in my PO Box, insured - $5.50 Because NADS is all natural, it is the only hair removal method that is completely safe for the environment, even shaving cream pollutes our lakes and streams. Please see my feedback and you will know how nicely I treat folks! SEE MY FEEDBACK HERE I only accept paypal or genuine US post office money orders as payment, so make sure that is OK with you before bidding. I reserve the right to cancel bids from bidders with over 1% neg. feedback or a total feedback rating of less than 3 unless you email me first to discuss it. I ship internationally to the following countries provided you pay via paypal: Argentina _ Australia _ Austria _ Belgium _ Brazil _ Canada _ China _ Costa Rica _ Denmark _ Dominican Republic _ Finland _ Germany _ Greece _ Hong Kong _ Iceland _ India _ Ireland _ Israel _ Italy _ Japan _ Jamaica _ Luxembourg _ Mexico _ Netherlands _ New Zealand _ Norway _ Portugal _ Singapore _ South Africa _ South Korea _ Spain _ Sweden _ Switzerland _ United Kingdom Buyers outside of USA pay actual international shipping/insurance costs. Paypal is currently the only form of payment I can accept from my international friends. I hope to be able to take other payment forms in the future.

All of my auctions are stain free, tear free and wear free, unless I have told of such items...I value my customers and try to explain to the best of my ability! If I were to overlook something , and you need to return the item, then I will refund your final price of the auction, not the postage. Most things, I do not make enough on to refund shipping also! Sorry! All auctions are sent next day with Money Order or PayPal and in 10 days for checks, with less than 50 positive feedbacks. I ship priority, and I will email you right after the auction ends to let you know your actual priority charge....I charge for actual shipping, never any hidden charges!!!! If the item is bigger or there is a more than one piece then it might be a little higher, depending on the weight. Bigger items, such as furniture and such, I will take to the PO after I get your mailing address and see what the charge will be, and that is what you will pay, I don't charge a handling fee at all!!!! I also combine auctions to save you in shipping!!!! I like for people to do that for me, so I like to do it for YOU.....Thanks so much for checking us out! Congratulations on winning my auction!

    <Description>Dolce and Gabbana J&amp;ANS Fabulous Red Denim Jeans How do you make the world_s sexiest jeans EVEN sexier? Make them red, of course! These are the classic, sexy Dolce and Gabbana jeans I usually have posted in black, but they are a slightly different cut, line and of course, they are fire engine RED! First, the cut: These are a straight-leg cut, less tapered and curved than the others, more like 501_s. Second, the line: these are from the HOTTEST of D&amp;G_s lines, _J&amp;ANS_. They come with tags attached as well as additional buttons and rivets. These jeans are currently sold in stores for $200! These are completely Authentic, Brand New, and Perfect--so WHY PAY MORE?? Size is 29, but since the Italian sizing can be screwy, go by the measurements. WAIST: 29 inches HIPS: 39 inches INSEAM: 30 inches Shipping: $6 in the US, more elsewhere. If you have a question about shipping, ask it BEFORE you bid. Insurance: Optional, $1.10 up to $50, $2 over $50 Payment: Expected within 10 days of auction close. Methods of Payment: Paypal, Bidpay, Money Order, Personal Check (held to clear). ALL SALES ARE FINAL. Unless I grossly misrepresent an item, the sale is final. I am not a big store, and cannot absorb the losses that come from returns. This is why I give you as much information as possible. Remember--just because you always wear one size, it does not mean you will be that size in Italian jeans!! PLEASE DO NOT BID IF YOU CANNOT PAY. I DO LEAVE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK AND CHARGE $20 FOR RETURNED CHECKS. I LOVE ALL YOU HONEST EBAYERS AND HATE THE DEADBEATS THAT MAKE THIS HARD FOR EVERYONE!!

    <Description>Chico's Design Straight Skirt Sz. 1 Mocha This is a great skirt made of 88% acetate and 18% nylon and has a sort of "nubbly" texture. The colour appears to me as mocha. It is a long skirt. A super piece for casual, business or dressy. PLEASE NOTE: Comes from a cat/smoking environment, friendly though. PAYMENT OPTIONS: PayPal preferred and ships the fastest / M.O. next best / CHECK, well, slow boat to China as it takes at least 10 WORKING days to clear the bank and maybe longer due to time of year. SHIPPING: USPS priority $4.50. Consider insurance @ 1.10 additional as I can't be responsible once I mail it. Response expected within 3 days of auction close or I reserve the right to relist item. Payment to be received within 8 days, again, consider time of year for mail. I always leave feedback. Thank you for browsing with me and please see my other auctions currently on ebay.

    <Description>Check Out My Other Auctions for Great Holiday and Formal Wear Size: Small on the tag Manufacturer: I am not sure - I cannot quite make out the letters. I think it says IPICANO Material: Cotton Condition: Mint - no problems This black and white shirt was in a lot of items I bought and everyone who has seen it has said, "don't auction that - nobody will want that thing." I have to say, it is an odd shirt, but that's what makes it unique and one of a kind. I called it a "hands" shirt because that was a first impression - it's like hands with lots of fingers draped over your shoulders. They are covered with silver sequins. The sleeves are quilted so stand out like that over your shoulders. The material feels like a cotton twill, a good sturdy material, not thin at all. This one could be dressy or casual. The one thing it will always be is a conversation starter!! MEASUREMENTS 38" Bust and body 25" Long from the top of the shoulders Measurements are actual, with no stretching. When measuring I lay them flat, measure the width of each location and double. The bust is measured approximately 1/2" beneath the armpit seam. The waist is measured at the narrowest place on the garments. The hips are measured at 10" below the waist. Buyer to pay $3.00 shipping USA. International figured separately. Insurance and/or delivery confirmation extra if desired. Money order, cash or personal check, PayPal, or BidPay accepted. I am always glad to combine shipping on multiple wins within a reasonable length of time. Please note that colors can appear differently on different monitors. If there is any question about colors please ask before bidding. My low opening bid in no way reflects on the quality. Consider me your own PERSONAL SHOPPER. I love to go shopping and find bargains to pass along to you. Some things are new; some of them are used. But all of them are things I'd be happy to own myself. I often start the bidding below $10.00 to save on Ebay's listing fees and to give you the opportunity to enjoy being part of the bidding. I carefully inspect my items and note any flaws in the ad description. I clearly state how and where the measurements are taken. No refunds unless I have grossly misrepresented the item. If you have any questions, please write and ask. SEWCAKES@AOL.COM PLEASE DO NOT BID ON MY AUCTIONS IF YOU CANNOT PAY within 14 days after receipt of my confirmation letter at close of auction. If payment is not received by the 14th day, or we have not made other arrangements, I will file a non-pay bidder alert with Ebay, cancel the deal, leave negative feedback and relist the item. THANKS FOR LOOKING AT MY AUCTIONS I mostly sell new and vintage formal dresses and gowns that are suitable for a variety of wearers and events such as cruise, reunion, anniversary, pageant, prom or any special occasion where you may need something fancy to wear.

    <Description>Nice Leather! This auction is for a nice heavy leather handbag with lots of pockets. The color is a rich brown. The The measurements are about 12 inches across, about 9 inches tall and about 3 inches wide at the bottom. There is one thick adjustable strap (this I think is made of vinyl though). There is one big center pocket and two side pockets, one in the front and one in the back. This item has never been used and it is in new condition ready for Christmas giving. I will have this out as soon as payment is received after auction end so you will have it by Christmas. Please email me with any questions. Due to the nature of most items sold (those not listed as "new"), all sales are final. I do my very best to VERY carefully examine all items for defects prior to listing and any flaws I find will be described in the item description. It is possible that even with careful inspection a slight defect may go unnoticed...however, this is rare and I take every step possible to keep this from happening. I now accept Paypal and payments should be sent to rightbooks@pcweb.net only or you can pay with a personal check or money order/cashiers check. I will ship right out for money orders or Paypal but have to hold the merchandise for a personal check to clear. Winning bidder pays for the item plus $4.50 for priority mail and delivery confirmation anywhere in the United States. I will be happy to combine items in my auctions to save on shipping. Insurance is at your request only and is recommended since I can_t be responsible for post office loss or damage once the package has left my hands.

SRP $16.00 Size Small (waist 28"-30") Size Medium =(waist 32"-34") Size Large= (waist 36"-38") Size XL= (waist 40"-42") Shipping Costs: THERE ARE 2 OPTIONS: #1= UPS Ground with insurance and tracking for $5.50 (why so much? Because that is how much it costs to ship a package via UPS-sometimes it costs $6.40 to send 1 pair of boxers-Sorry, we have no control over UPS rates and we DO NOT make any money off of packages being shipped UPS-we actually end up losing money so please don't send nasty emails to us regarding shipping costs).
