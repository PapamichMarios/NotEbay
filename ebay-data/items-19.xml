Whether you are a beginning or advanced guitarist, you will benefit from Fred Hand's in-depth explorationof the fundamental principles of classical guitar technique. "Your body and mind have an innate ability to express the music that you hear," says Hand, "you only need to tap into this source." By learning the essentials of good playing, such as posture, relaxation, fingernail shaping and the correct application of the free stroke and rest stroke, you will quickly become a smoother and more efficient player. As you practice your arpeggios, scales, vibrato, trills and cross-string trills, you'll learn to apply them to beautiful classical-style pieces such as John Dowland's "Lady Hunnsden's Puffe" and a dance by Gaspar Sanz. Hand's own compositions, "A Celtic Tale," "Heartsong " and "Lesley's Song" are perfect examples of the application of classical techniques to pieces in a contemporary setting. This is a lesson that will dramatically improve the playing of both classical musicians and fingerstyle guitarists of other tradition. About Frederic Frederick Hand's 30-year recording, composing and touring career has garnered rave reviews from critics throughout the world. He has performed with Luciano Pavarotti, Placido Domingo, Zubin Mehta, Pierre Boulez, The Waverly Consort, Mostly Mozart Orchestra and his own ensemble, Jazzantiqua. He arranged and performed the theme from Academy Award-winning film "Kramer Vs. Kramer," which led to best-selling recordings "Baroque and On The Street" (Sony) and "Jazzantiqua" (Musicmasters/BMG). Mr. Hand is currently on the faculty of Mannes College of Music and has given masterclasses at the New England Conservatory, Boston Conservatory, Yale University and Emory University. His compositions are published and recorded around the world. He is the 1996 Emmy-award winning composer for "The Guiding Light." The New York Times wrote, "He played unerringly, with all the verve and spirit that one could ask," while the Milwaulkee Sentinel called Hand "A brilliant master of the guitar." 75 Minute VHS Video, In Gently Used Condition.

    <Description>Here's a very interesting lot of 3 photos from the 1931 British &amp; Dominions Film Corportation production of "The Speckled Band." Short-running (48 minutes) mystery marked the film debut of Raymond Massey, who portrayed the legendary sleuth Sherlock Holmes. That's Massey at center in the JPG. Forgive the poor scan -- actual photo is much better. Massey is not shown in the other 2 photos. All 3 of the 8 X 10 original photos show edge and corner wear, a pinhole or two here and there and some other problems, but nothing detracts too much. Editor's crayon code in upper left of each photo can be easily and completely removed by using a soft, NON-MOIST tissue. Overall condition merits good-minus, considering age and handling. An attractive lot perhaps for the more advanced film collector, taking into account it was Massey's first film. Come sleeved and with backing board. Buyer to pay $3.50 for secure first-class shipping. Please see my other top-quality and interesting old movie photos, other photos, books, paper collectibles and memorabilia now on sale.

    <Description>CALL OF THE WILD STARRING: Rick Schroder and Mia Sara Brand New Factory Sealed DVD Never Opened! Never Viewed! Call of the Wild, Jack London's classic story of a young man's adventure in the Yukon, is transformed into a breathtaking, action packed film starring Lonesome Dove's Rick Schroder and Mia Sara (Ferris Bueller's Day Off). Shot on location in the rustic wilderness of British Columbia, it's an exciting film the whole family will enjoy. It's 1897 and young John Thorton feels the need to break free from his father's overbearing grip. John jumps a steamer north to join the frenzied fever of the Yukon Gold Rush. But "the call of the wild" is not the place pictured in his romantic dreams. Harsh weather, unforgiving terrain, hostile Indians and cutthroat miners remind him he is far from home. John Thorton is struggling for survival, but he has three good reasons to stay alive: Charlie, a wise Indian who becomes his friend and teacher, Sue, the first true love of his life, and Buck the courageous dog who helps show him the true meaning of life. Together they will share joy and sorrow in an unforgetable adventure of discovery. A real classic. DVD DETAILS: Rated G; 97 minutes; Color; Coded Region 1 (US and Canada).

    <Description>Cool BARBARELLA Japanese Movie Poster Mint! Click picture to enlarge Click picture to enlarge Click picture to enlarge Description BARBARELLA THE AWESOME JAPANESE ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER OF THE CLASSIC JANE FONDA MOVIE! YOU ARE BIDDING ON THIS AWESOME MOVIE POSTER WHICH IS THE JAPANESE ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER AND IS IN MINT CONDITION, NEVER USED WITH SHARP EDGES AND CORNERS AND COMES ROLLED, PROTECTIVELY WRAPPED IN PLASTIC, CUSHIONED AND SECURED AND SHIPPED IN A PROTECTIVE TUBE (WE HAVE OVER 10 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE MAIL-ORDER BUSINESS SO BID WITH CONFIDENCE!!!). POSTER INFORMATION: THIS IS THE JAPANESE ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER. IT MEASURES 26x39 (APPROX) AND IS AN ORIGINAL STUDIO RE-ISSUED MOVIE POSTER (NOT A POSTER-HOUSE REPRINT!!!). When the studios started to realize there was a mass market for their movie posters, they have gone back and re-issued several of them. This poster is one of them. It is identical to the first printing done by the studio. Only an appraiser could probably tell the difference. Now, as far as collectability goes, to give you an example - First printings for BARBARELLA posters sell for a few hundred dollars (if you can even find one). The studio realized that this was not appropriate for the average person who wanted the poster for their wall and so they went back and re-issued the poster in mass quantity and so the value of the re-issues is not like the first printings, yet you get basically the same quality.

Click picture to enlarge Click picture to enlarge Click picture to enlarge Description A CLOCKWORK ORANGE THE AWESOME US REGULAR ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER OF THE CLASSIC KUBRICK FILM! YOU ARE BIDDING ON THIS AWESOME MOVIE POSTER WHICH IS THE US REGULAR ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER AND IS IN MINT CONDITION, NEVER USED WITH SHARP EDGES AND CORNERS AND COMES PACKAGED ROLLED, WRAPPED IN PLASTIC FOR MOISTURE PROTECTION, CUSHIONED, WRAPPED AND SHIPPED IN A PROTECTIVE TUBE (WE HAVE OVER 10 YEARS EXPERIENCE IN THE MAIL-ORDER BUSINESS SO BID WITH CONFIDENCE!!!). POSTER INFORMATION: THIS IS THE US ONE SHEET MOVIE POSTER. IT MEASURES 27x40 (APPROX) AND IS AN ORIGINAL STUDIO RE-ISSUED MOVIE POSTER (NOT A POSTER-HOUSE REPRINT!!!). When the studios started to realize there was a mass market for their movie posters, they have gone back and re-issued several of them. This poster is one of them. It is identical to the first printing done by the studio. Only an appraiser could probably tell the difference. Now, as far as collectability goes, to give you an example - First printings for A CLOCKWORK ORANGE posters sell for about $350 each (if you can even find one). The studio realized that this was not appropriate for the average person who wanted the poster for their wall and so they went back and re-issued the poster in mass quantity and so the value of the re-issues is not like the first printings, yet you get basically the same quality. This provides an affordable alternative for someone to obtain a poster for a movie like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Again, this is NOT a poster-house reprint.

    <Description>OSMOSIS JONES Farrelly Bros. Bill Murray NEW, UNOPENED, FACTORY SEALED! DVD After the stiff attempts at realism in many recent features, it's a treat to see broad cartoon-style animation on the big screen in Osmosis Jones, a spoof of cop movies set inside the human body. The title character (voice by Chris Rock) is a street-smart white blood cell, working for Frank's immune system. He and Drix (David Hyde Pierce), an over-the-counter cold capsule, are reluctant partners fighting what appears to be a minor infection. Osmosis discovers Frank has really contracted a fatal virus, Thrax (Laurence Fishburne): he battles a corrupt body politic led by a venal mayor (William Shatner) to save Frank's life and win the affection of the mayor's aide, Leah (Brandy Norwood). Rock's motor-mouth delivery can get annoying, but it contrasts nicely with straight arrow Drix (imagine a fussy Buzz Lightyear). Excellent drawing and a powerful vocal performance make Thrax a genuinely frightening villain. DVD Features: Regional Code: Region .1 Layers: Dual Audio Tracks: English 5.1, French 5.1, Spanish 2.0 DTS Audio Tracks: none Subtitles: French, Closed-captioned: Yes Ratios: Widescreen No A/R, Anamorphic Special Features: Under the Microscope - Behind the Scenes Commentary By Director, Writers, Producers including Farrelly Bros. Deleted "Spleens" Cell to Cinema Process Reel Frank's Highlight Reel Cast/Crew Bios Trailers ADD 3.95 SHIPPING(FIRM).I SHIP EVERYDAY EXCEPT SUNDAY. PAYPAL OR MONEY ORDER ONLY. (NO CHECKS) PLEASE SEE MY OTHER DVD AUCTIONS. ALL MY DVD'S ARE NEW,UNOPENED,AND FACTORY SEALED! REGION 1, NO IMPORTS!! JUST LIKE WHAT YOU BUY IN THE STORE! ADD ONLY 1.50 SHIPPING FOR EACH ADDITIONAL DVD.THREE OR MORE DVD'S GETS PRIORITY SHIPPING.PLEASE CONTACT ME WITHIN 48 HOURS TO ARRANGE PAYMENT. PAYMENT DUE WITHIN 10 DAYS OF AUCTION END.

    <Description>Afraid of the Dark (1992) Starring: Ben Keyworth, James Fox, Paul McGann An alienated 12-year-old with failing eyesight hunts a killer who brutally assaults blind people. Just when he uncovers the identity of the culprit, he discovers a deeper evil. Buyer prepays price of movie plus $4.00 shipping and handling via USPS 1st class rate. Payment can be made by check, money order, or by credit card through Paypal. Payment must be made within 10 days of the close of the auction. Please view my other movies on auction and save on shipping. I list hundreds of movies every week. So that you may want to make many purchases I have lowered my shipping charges for multiple purchases. I charge $4.00 for the first movie, $2.00 for the second, and $1.00 for each additional movie. I allow seven days between the close of the first auction and the last. I highly recommend that insurance be purchased for videos shipped in the United States. I cannot and will not be held responsible for movies lost or damaged in the mail. Insurance only costs $1.10 to insure the delivery. If living outside the U.S. postage will be higher and the cost will be confirmed after the auction has closed. International orders cannot be insured. The costs are quite high to do this. All of our movies are previously viewed unless otherwise indicated. The picture depicted is not necessarily the one that is available due to the fact that some movies have various sleeves. Please do not bid if you do not intend to purchase. A $20 dollar service charge will be assessed for bad checks. Shop 1000's of used movies at Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

PLEASE SEE OUR WEBSITE FOR MORE ORIGINAL IRON ONS info: http://www.geocities.com/rockteeshirts We are selling some OLD STOCK Deadstock IRON ON (Iron-on) transfers from the 1970s. The transfers are about 11 x 14 or so, and on original paper backings, so the images are not as sharp as the actual transfer, once it is applied, yet somewhat stronger than the actual image as seen through the transfer paper. We sharpened the image so you can see more of what the actual image looks like when transfered. We held them up to a sunny window, and photographed them, then enhanced them in our photo editor, we tried :) Thanks for watching! Good Luck. NO RESERVE Buyer to pay $2.00 for shipping and handling.

    <Description>A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET 3 Dream Warriors Robert Englund -- Patricia Arquette -- Heather Langenkamp -- Laurence Fishburne Priscilla Pointer -- Craig Wasson VHS The best of the Elm Street sequels, this creepy, surreal fantasy features terrific effects, a fine young cast, and an air of grim fatalism that sets it apart from its successors. Patricia Arquette stars as Kristen, whose nightmare leads to a slashed wrist which looks suspiciously like a suicide attempt. She is placed in a hospital psychiatric ward with a group of six other troubled teens, who all dream about the same horribly burned man, Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) trying to kill them. Perhaps the most unusual thing about this picture, however, is the unexpected depth of sadness running through it. There are some achingly sweet moments in this otherwise frightening film which, though not disruptive, are impossible to analyze. The first and most bizarre of these is the entrance of dream researcher Nancy Thompson (Heather Langenkamp), which inexplicably causes most viewers to get misty-eyed, and there are several similar scenes throughout the film. One answer can be found in the sensitive direction of Chuck Russell, who emphasizes the tragedy and utter hopelessness in these kids' lives and manages to wring some unexpectedly perceptive turns from his cast. This is a film in which a great deal of care was obviously lavished on individual scenes (the sets are outstanding) and performances. The results are well worth repeated viewings, and prove that sequels don't necessarily have to be inferior films. This video is previously viewed but from a private collection in its original box. The box has some wear but overall is in good condition. The tape is in excellent condition.

About Us We (Trene and Josh) "met" when Trene bought something from Josh on e-Bay. We developed an e-mail friendship, then a phone friendship and thought there might be more. So we decided to meet, and are now working on figuring out where our relationship/friendship goes from here. One big problem. She lives in Alaska and he lives in Los Angeles. Long distance relationships can get expensive, with the phone bills if nothing else, so we decided to sell together on e-Bay to help defray the costs. Are we telling you this to appeal to your sappy sense of sentimentality so you'll bid higher? Absolutely! Good luck and happy bidding!! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>This 189 page Battlestar Galactica T.V. pilot script contains not only all the DIALOGUE and ACTION from the show but a CAST LIST as well. This is the script, dated May 1978, of the 3 hour spectaular episode that started it all on ABC and introduced the commanding and august ADAMA (LORNE GREENE from BONANZA, not the 'Host' on ANGEL), the handsome and heroic APOLLO (RICHARD HATCH from THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO and ALL MY CHILDREN, not the winner from SURVIVOR I), the sexy and mischievous STARBUCK (DIRK BENEDICT from THE A TEAM, not the coffee house founder. :)) and the lovely but doomed SERINA (JANE SEYMOUR from DR. QUINN MEDICINE WOMAN and SOMEWHERE IN TIME). Read how the spacefaring tribes of humanity were attacked by the evil CYLONS in a Pearl Harbor like surprise attack and how they rallied to an epic search to find the lost tribe of humanity on Earth.

    <Description>THE 18 BRONZEMEN China is in a state of upheaval. The Manchurians have invaded. They target one of the Ming dynasty's most loyal patriots, a general, and eliminate him along with many others. The only survivor of the massacre is the General's infant son, Shao Lung. He and another young boy, Tien Pang, end up at Shao Lin Temple and begin to learn the martial arts. The training is meant to prepare the young men for a series of 36 tests that must eventually be passed, the last being the fiercely challenging and usually fatal test of the 18 Bronzemen. After twenty years of devotion, the time at last comes to take on the 36 tests. Only by passing the tests can Shao Lung meet his destiny. Chinese language widescreen edition with English subtitles packaged in a white case (sorry no color insert). Will play in all US VCR's. Mint condition. Mega RARE!

I accept paypal, billpoint, cash, and international money orders. This DVD package includes both 101 and 102 Dalmations. Unleashing every ounce of Disney magic, 101 Dalmatians thrilled audiences of all ages with fast-paced adventure and comedy - featuring a brilliant performance by five-time Academy Award nominee Glenn Close as Cruella De Vil. Achieving new heights of hilarity, Disney's all-time classic puppy tale came to life as a worldwide box office sensation. In their small London flat, Dalmatians Pongo and Perdy, and their human "pets" Roger and Anita, are overjoyed by the arrival of 15 puppies. But when the spotted-fur-loving Ms. De Vil and her clumsy cohorts, Jasper and Horace, dognap the litter - along with every other Dalmatian pup in London - Pongo and Perdy must rally the town's animals to their rescue. The plan hurls them towards a thrilling climax filled with uproarious moments as the puppies attempt to outwit their captors and bring on a final showdown with Cruella! 102 Dalmations Cruella De Vil has been conditioned like Pavlov's dogs to resist her passion for pups, but is she really reformed? When it all comes undone, she's doggoned determined to gather 101 Dalmatians to make her black and white coat. Make that 102 Dalmatians: She's decided to add a hood! Glenn Close, G rard Depardieu and Ioan Gruffudd star. STARRING: Glenn Close, Jeff Daniels. DIRECTED BY: Stephen Herek. SPECIAL FEATURES: Color, Closed-captioned. PLEASE NOTE: Two Disc Set.

    <Description>.titledata { font-family: verdana, sans-serif; font-size:17px; color:#336666; font-weight : bold; } .description { font-family: verdana, sans-serif; color:#000000; } .link { font-family: verdana, sans-serif; font-size:12px; underline; } HR { color: #000000; } JUNE 1914 THE THEATRE-George M. Cohan &amp; MORE! I came into a huge collection of THE THEATRE magazines this weekend - circa 1900 to 1918. A lot of them have great articles, great pics of the great theatrical people of that time, and lots of wonderful ads - some black &amp; white and some color. So from this wonderful collection of paper I am offering: A complete June 1914 issue of THE THEATRE. I can't even begin to tell you what you get inside but I will detail some of the highlights: A very nice FRAMEABLE cover (light carboard) of MISS LAURETTE TAYLOR in "Peg O' My Heart"; a back cover (light cardboard) color page for PACKARD; black and white ads for Lord &amp; Taylor ("Onyx Hosiery"); Columbia Graphophone Co (endorsed by Vernon Castle); Good Year; Wilcox &amp; White Co Pianos; Victrola; Burgesser Hats; Lucky Strike Cigarettes; Speedway Runabout; BVD; Riz La Famous Cigarette Papers; Egyptian Deities Cigarettes; Violet Sec Toilet Water. Color ad (inside back cover) for MURAD Cigarettes. B&amp;W pictures/articles of Ethel Barrymore, Marie Nordstrom, Marie Wallace, Flo Hart, Bessie Gross, Lydia Lopokova, Inez Plummer, Margaret Anglin, Cecil Kern, Eva Davenport, Grace George, Lois Meredith, Ann Swinburne, Grace Valentine, Lawrence Dorsay, Robert Mantell, Vivian Rushmore, Julia Marlow, Frances Starr, Vera Finley. Articles include WHAT THE AMERICAN FLAG HAS DONE FOR ME by George M. Cohan, BILLIE BURKE in Her Home, WHAT IS A JEUVENILE LEAD? by JOHN BARRYMORE. The cover is frameable - nicks at the edges, a few small cuts at the edges, wear on the spine but for something almost 100 years old, I think you will forgive the small stuff! What you see is what you get - I used the digital camera to take the pics cause my scanner wouldn't take in the whole print. The pages of the magazine measure 10" x 14". GORGEOUS SUBDUED COLOR! (look for other fabulous paper I have up in other categories!) NO RESERVE AFTER OPENING BID!! Winning bidder to pay for priority shipping (the reason for this is the cardboard the USPO provides makes sure that you get this item in perfect condition as it as so large). Insurance is at your discretion. I love money orders (asap shipping) and PAYPAL (asap shipping) but I will take a personal check with a 10-day hold on the goods while the check clears. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me at wimsey@mediaone.net. Thanks and GOOD LUCK! Payment I accept the following forms of payment: PayPal, Money Order, Personal Check.

    <Description>Monster on the Campus Bye Bye Birdie VHS Dick Van Dyke Sullivan NIB Bye Bye Birdie You are bidding on a factory sealed VHS, " Bye Bye Birdie " starring Janet Leigh, Dick Van Dyke, Ann-Margret, Maureen Stapleton, Bobby Rydell, Jesse Pearson and Ed Sullivan. Directed by George Sydney. Based on Elvis Presley's decision to join the army at the height of his popularity, this 1963 film introduces rock 'n' roller Conrad Birdie (Jesse Pearson) just before he's off to boot camp. But first, he has to say goodbye to his adoring fans, especially to the beautiful Kim McAfee (Ann-Margaret), who runs a fan club nearby. Suddenly all the kids in town are bucking authority and having far too much fun - which naturally makes the adults nervous. Bye Bye Birdie is a wild romp about the birth of rock and roll and all the change it brought with it. Ann-Margaret's songs are sexy enough to compete with anything Madonna's done on film, while Dick Van Dyke's portrayal of a smooth-talkin' PR man is an eerie look at the direction show biz would take. (NTSC, English, Color, 112 minutes, Hi Fi, 1963) Lucky winner to pay $4.00 surface shipping or $6.00 air mail shipping (US or Can).

Region 1 Dvd (playable on all U.S. and Canadian Dvd Players) This fast-paced film is a hilarious satire about a futuristic society where a no-holds-barred auto race is nationally televised and points are scored by running down pedestrians! Sylvester Stallone and David Carradine are competitors, with Stallone providing a lot of howls playing a gangster-type with a machine gun in his car. This nonstop, comic book action movie is brutally funny and remains a cult favorite. Shipping is $3.50 to anywhere in the USA. Payment by Money order, Check, Cash (very risky because it cannot be traced), and paypal! Thanks for looking and good luck.

USE _BUY IT NOW_ , PAYPAL AND PRIORITY MAIL AND GET YOUR ORDER IN TIME FOR CHRISTMAS !* ALL PAYPAL ORDERS SHIPPED IN 24 HOURS! PAYPAL ORDERS SUBMITTED BEFORE NOON PST ARE SHIPPED THE SAME DAY! PLEASE SEE MY PERFECT FEEDBACK RATING AND COMMENTS REGARDING MY QUALITY OF MERCHANDISE AND CARE OF PACKING &amp; SHIPPING! This auction is ONLY for the single DVD title of this ad, one of 250+ (Region 1 only) DVD_s I currently have listed on eBay. You can view this title in the stack in the picture above (and hopefully see other titles that you may be interested in!). All of these DVD_s are from my private collection and all were purchased new, there are ABSOLUTELY NO RENTAL COPIES. All the discs are in mint condition with no fingerprints or scratches, they literally look brand new! TERMS OF SALE: To get your order as fast as possible, please _Buy It Now_ and go right to the PAYPAL site by clicking on their logo below to pay for your item. PAYPAL confirmed payments only. Money orders receive immediate shipping. Personal checks are welcome, but are held 10 working days before shipment. Buyer pays $5 Priority Mail shipping/handling. And, yes, I will combine multiple disc orders to save on shipping, BUT PLEASE E-MAIL ME BEFORE YOU PAY so I can tell you how much! OPTIONAL USPS SERVICES: Choose and add the following rates to your payment: Insurance: If your order is up to $50 in value, add $1.10; $51 to $100 in value, add $2; $101 to $199 in value, add $3; if higher, please inquire Delivery Confirmation: $.40 Signature Delivery Confirmation: $1.40 Please provide an address which can receive a daytime shipment safely. If you include your full 10-digit ZIP (which can be found on any piece of junk mail addressed to you), your item will probably arrive faster. IMPORTANT IF YOU CHOOSE NOT TO INSURE: I am not responsible and do not provide refunds for items lost in the mail or stolen after delivery. ALSO: During shipping, DVD_s can shake loose from the retaining spindle inside their keep-boxes. The disc can receive slight scratches (but probably will still play perfectly), but I do not provide returns or refunds if this happens. One final caveat: If you have any question about what version a particular disc is (special edition, etc.), please make sure you ASK BEFORE YOU BUY: ALL SALES ARE FINAL. *NOTE: Priority Mail orders are supposed to arrive in 2 days, but the Post Office does not guarantee that. If the Post Office doesn_t get it there in time for Christmas, I will not accept the item for return. But just think: It_ll make a nice birthday or Valentine_s Day gift! THANKS AND MERRY CHRISTMAS!</Description>

It is in its original slip cover and runs perfectly! Sort of a cross between That Thing You Do! and Still Crazy, The Suburbans follows a one-hit '80s new-wave band (played by Craig Bierko, Will Ferrell, and cowriters Tony Guma and Donal Lardner Ward) who pull themselves together to play their hit at a wedding and then find themselves pursued by a young record executive (Jennifer Love Hewitt) who wants to revive their careers. The band is enthusiastic until they discover that their rock career is now becoming a a combination of muckraking interviews and intrusive, round-the-clock videotaping _ la VH1's Behind the Music.

There is no conventional dialogue to progress the narrative. Our story is about Pink, a rock and roll performer, who sits locked in a hotel room, somewhere in Los Angeles. Too many shows, too much dope, too much applause: a burned out case. On the TV, an all-too-familiar war film flickers on the screen. We shuffle time and place, reality and nightmare, as we venture into Pink's painful memories, each one a 'brick' in the wall he has gradually built around his feelings. Slowly he withdraws from the real world and slips further into his nightmare as he imagines himself as an unfeeling demagogue, for whom all that is left is the demonstration of power over his unthinking audience, the culmination of the odious excess of his own world and the world around him. His internal self trial follows, as the witnesses of his past life, the very people who have contributed to the building of the wall, come forward and testify against him. --Alan Parker Pink Floyd The Wall: Deluxe DVD Edition features: New Hi-Definition film transfer from the original widescreen interpositive. Previously unreleased footage. Remastered 5.1 Dolby Digital and Surround Encoded PCM Stereo Soundtracks from the original master tapes. The Other Side Of The Wall: A 25-minute documentary about the making of the film. Running commentary from Roger Waters and Gerald Scarfe. Retrospective: A new 45-minute documentary with interviews with Roger Waters, Gerald Scarfe, Alan Parker, Peter Biziou, Alan Marshall and James Guthrie. Original film trailer and production stills.

    <Description>GALAXINA This super sexy sci-fi parody pokes fun at such "space operas" as Star Wars and Alien as it chronicles the adventures of the starship Infinity where poor Captain Cornelius Butt finds himself playing "mommy" to a baby alien while handsome crewman Thor falls in love with the beautiful robot femme fatale pilot Galaxina and tries to turn her into a real woman. The film is best known for being the last screen appearance of rising-starlet Dorothy Stratten, the beautiful 20-year-old Playboy model who was brutally murdered by her estranged husband shortly after this film premiered. English language VHS version with Japanese subtitles. Tape is packaged in a plain collectors case (sorry no color artwork). Mint condition. Mega RARE! Sold from one collector to another.

    <Description>USE THE "BUY IT NOW" FEATURE AND GET FREE MEDIA MAIL SHIPPING IN THE UNITED STATES!! You are bidding on a BRAND NEW(factory sealed) VHS video of JAZZ SCENE 1962 USA's broadcast of STAN KENTON and FRANK ROSOLINO. This nationally syndicated television program, the brainchild of life-long jazz devotee Steve Allen, was a series which showcases many jazz performers. Uncompromising in its use of imaginative camera angles, the visual style is on par with the creativity of the music. These shows are time capsules to treasure from America's golden age of television. FRANK ROSOLINO (1926-1978) was quite simply one of the most brilliant trombone stylists in jazz history. His exceptional technique and exuberant personality sent bolts of intensity through every solo. After extensive experience in the big bands of Bob Chester, Glen Gray, Gene Krupa, with whom he recorded and filmed the delightful Lemon Drop, Tony Pastor, Herbie Fields and Stan Kenton, plus the wonderful 1951 Georgie Auld Quartet, he settled in Los Angeles in 1954. It wasn't long before ROSOLINO was trombonist numero uno on the West Coast, working regularly with the Lighthouse All Stars, and frequently getting calls for record, film and TV studio work. His rhythm section on this broadcast included a young Mike Melvoin on piano, bassist Bob Bertaux, and drummer Nick Martinis. The set consists mostly of standards: Yesterdays (at an unusually fast tempo) Mean To Me Please Don't Bug Me Lover Man and Thelonious Monk's Well You Needn't The stature of STAN KENTON (1912-1979) in the pantheon of big band jazz remains unchallenged to this day, more than fifty years after he made his first waves in the early 1940's. Committed to music education and the nurturing of young talent, through his band's ranks passed many of modern jazz's most compelling performers, including Art Pepper, Stan Getz, Shelly Manne, Maynard Ferguson, Anita O'Day, June Christy, Lee Konitz, Frank Rosolino, Conte Condoli, and Mel Lewis, to name just a few. Kenton's controversial emphasis on composition in the jazz idiom encouraged the work of such writers as Pete Rugolo, Bill Russo, Gerry Mulligan and Shorty Rogers. Marvin Stamm is on trumpet, Don Menza on tenor, and Bob Fitzpatrick on trombone are featured here along with Kenton performing: Limehouse Blues All The Things You Are Waltz of the Prophets Maria Malaguena The video is 60 minutes in length, recorded in SP Mode/RealTime. Winning bidder (Other than the "BUY IT NOW" winner) to pay an additional $2.50 for Media Mail, $3.50 for First Class Mail OR $4.50 for Priority Mail in the US. Optional insurance is available @ $1.10 per item. Also, with the holiday season upon us, we will gift wrap and send your package to a third person as a gift. Fees apply. Foreign rates apply per country of destination. Paypal is gladly accepted! Please see our feedback and bid with confidence. Also, check our other auctions and save a little money when you combine the shipping of two or more winning items. Thank you and good luck.</Description>

    <Description>ON VALENTINE'S DAY VHS An American Love Story AKA On Valentine's Day - Story of a Marriage . Set in the American South, a small town. From the play Valentine's Day by Horton Foote . A prequel to Horton Foote's 1918 (released in 1985) On Valentine's Day was filmed in 1984, then held back from release till 1986. On the titular day, Elizabeth Vaughn ( Hallie Foote, Horton's daughter) and Horace Robedeaux ( William Converse-Roberts ) elope. Horace stubbornly refuses to ask for financial assistance from his parents or in-laws, so the penniless couple is compelled to live in an inexpensive boarding house. Their fellow tenants are the usual assortment of eccentrics, including alcoholic Bobby Pate ( Richard Jenkins ), spinster Miss Ruth ( Carol Goodheart ), heartbroken George Tyler ( Steven Hill ) and garrulous young Bessie ( Jeanne McCarthy ). After several months of enduring the woes of the other boarders, Horace swallows his pride and agrees to allow father-in-law Michael Higgins to support him and Elizabeth . There's a reconciliation, but one tinged with the premonition that Horace and Elizabeth aren't out of the woods yet. Together with Portrait of a Marriage (never released theatrically), On Valentine's Day and 1918 were later reedited and incorporated into a Horton Foote TV trilogy on the PBS network. Director Ken Harrison . Starring: William Converse-Roberts, Hallie Foote, Michael Higgins, Steven Hill, Richard Jenkins, Carol Goodheart, Jeanne McCarthy, Matthew Broderick . Explicit Language, Adult Situations, Questionable for Children. Produced by American Playhouse / Angelika Films / Guadalupe / Hudson / Lumiere Prods. 1984. Running time: 106 min. Made for TV.

    <Description>Dimension Home Video; 1996; SP Mode; Rated; R; 108 Minutes; WIDESCREEN. This tape comes from my personal collection and has only been watched a couple of times. Both box and tape are in near excellent condition. The wild imaginations of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez team up for an over-the-top blast combination of vampires and gangsters that has become a cult legend. Tarantino and George Clooney are convict brothers on the run who take Harvey Keitel and his family, including daughter Juliette Lewis hostage. They go to a Mexican truck stop for a meet that turns into a nightmare when it turns out that the employees of the bar are all a bunch of vampires. Soon, there's only a handful of humans left. The action and gore are nearly nonstop, and the film plays much better in the widescreen mode. Look for Salma Hayek as a sexy vampire, along with Fred Hammer Williamson, special effects whiz Tom Savini and Cheech Marin (playing three different characters) in supporting roles. Winning buyer in US pays $4.00 for priority mail or $2.00 book rate ($1 additional per extra item if you buy more than one of my videos) shipping; personal checks OK but may be held until they clear unless you have sufficient positive feedback. Visa, Mastercard and AmEx accepted for orders over $20. Insurance is an optional $1.10 extra if desired. Winning bidder must submit payment within ten days of end of auction. Serious bidders only.

    <Description>Imma Youjo DVD Box Set NEW Hentai JAPANESE ANIME DVD / NTSC / OFFICAL U.S. RELEASE This five part series features very good animation, remarkable techniques, and -- quite unusual for this type of anime -- a story of real substance that attempts to delve into the deeper psychology of its characters. Each of the Chapters stands alone as a story, but the five together weave a rich tapestry. This award-winning anime series is being reconsidered as a classic of the art form, and shows just how far the art of the animation technique can be stretched. The story spreads over the past, the future, and all points in between, yet maintains a consistent point of view. What view?That there is in each of us, a power that sets us apart, that enables us to stand against terrible odds, that keeps us alive, that burns forever in spirit. NEW - Sealed Box!

    <Description>These are 2 very nice mini-posters (about 18 x 26 cm.)that were released for a limited time to give Japanese moviegoers a sneak peak into the upcoming movie, "Ocean's Eleven." Although I haven't seen this movie yet, I hear that it is fantastic. I also don't know what the American poster looks like, but you can see if it looks like either of the Japanese preview posters. As you can see, one poster has a photo of the 5 stars and the other is more stylized. Both posters have Japanese-language info about the movie on the back as well as more pictures of the five stars. Anyway, postage to the United States will be $2.50. Payments accepted: PAYPAL, International Postal Money Order and cash.

    <Description>MEXICAN MEMORABILIA! Quality Collectibles Since 2000! Just in time for Christmas_here are several neat movie-related items from M_xico! They will make someone very happy Christmas morning! Happy Holidays, and God bless. Take a look at our new website! Link below! Mexican lobby cards are larger (12.50 x 16.75) and often more colorful and action-packed than other lobbies. They usually come in a set of eight, with brightly colored artwork and a black and white inset photo which varies from card to card. These are actual, theater used posters. They come from a collector friend whose mother-in-law worked for a film distributor in M_xico City. She saved the ones she liked, and stored them carefully. They are a historical treasure today! Here's a wonderful Jane Powell item! It's a mini poster from Mexico, probably meant to be a calendar top, with Jane all dalmationed out. A good size 11.74 x 14.5 inches. Sweet and a bit campy--Jane looks great! Take a look at all my auctions--where else but at Mexican Memorabilia can you consistently find such a high percentage of unusual, quality collectibles you never see anywhere else? If you have trouble seeing my photos, please drop me a line and I will e- them out to you. CONDITION: Very light wear, two small tack holes!_See Photo! SHIPPING: $5.00 US, actual shipping cost overseas. We will combine orders whenever possible. Remember, shipping includes sending all items first from Mexico to Mom by special carrier, so they arrive with you safe, sound, and secure. I'm in Mexico looking for more stuff, but the treasures are in our New York warehouse (at Ma's) so shipping is quick and easy. PAYMENT WITHIN 10 DAYS, PLEASE! Money Orders much preferred--we mail to you within 24 hours. Personal Checks must clear, and total turnaround is often three weeks. Cash is swell, but send it at your risk! Remember, now you can use your credit card to pay with BidPay! Just click on their banner below. Please check out the other great auctions I currently have running on eBay. Take a look at our BRAND NEW Mexican Memorabilia web site! Most Mexican houses have no attic, so things like movie memorabilia and ephemera rarely get saved! I've been here in Guadalajara seven years, and it's taken me that long to make good collecting connections and know where to look. Collect movie star/TV star magazines? Lobby cards, movie-related displays and promotions? Advertisements? We've got all kinds of stuff, from the teens to the 60's. Speaking of all kinds of stuff--if you haven_t been to Bruce Hershenson_s, you are really missing out! Bruce has an incredible movie poster site, sells hundreds and hundreds of posters a week at auction, and hosts a movie poster e-mail club that is absolutely the best way to keep up with the hobby! Plus he_s one of the two nicest guys on the net (I_m the other one!). In e-Bay, just go to _search bidder_ and type emovieposter.com. Or see Bruce_s site at http://www.brucehershenson.com/emovieposter.htm . You can sign up for the poster club e-letter there. You_ll be glad you did! Bidding Ruby Lane Antiques &amp; Collectibles Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

These two had as good a chemistry as ANYONE! The musical guest is Devo-who put on quiet a performance.Here's your chance to own a "time capsule" of 2 stars at the height of all the G.H. hoopla!

A Nightmare on Elm Street, IV: The Dream Master Your fave psycho sandman is back! It's that one-man-sleep-disorder, the unspeakably demonic FREDDY KRUEGER, returning with a vengeance in A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master! But wait. This time around, the fiendish Freddy (ROBERT ENGLUND) is up against a powerful new adversary! After beautiful young Kristen sees the remaining Elm Street kids succumb one by one to Freddy's razor-edged wrath, she embarks on a desperate mission to release the tortured souls of Freddy's victims once and for all. Can this lone "Dream Master" defeat the satanic dreamstalker? Or will she have to wake up to the fact that no one is really ready...for Freddy? A special-effects-filled descent into sheer, unrelenting terror! Wes Craven's New Nightmare From the creator of "A Nightmare on Elm Street," Freddy's back and scarier than ever! As he slashes his way through the silver screen and turns reality blood red. Heather is an actress happily married, with a little boy named Dylan. She is worried about a maniac who is ringing frequently at her house. She thinks the maniac is Freddy, the killer of her previous film. Meanwhile, Wes Craven is having nightmares. Inspired by those events, he is writing the script for a new Nightmare series film. Heather is scared by some recent murders, as well as her son's schizophrenia. The only way left to save her son is to act for the last time, and play the part of Nancy to defeat Freddy forever. ARCADE All the kids in town are dying to play the hot new video game ARCADE. Trouble is, once you play the game you can kiss reality good-bye. Arcade has seven levels of excitement, adventure and terror for its players. The game transports you to another world with its stunning graphics, thrilling sound effects, and virtual reality simulation. It is the ultimate experience in a video game. But excitement like this doesn't come cheaply - when you battle with ARCADE you're putting your life on the line. The kids have accepted the challenge and are absorbed into the game. Only Alex (Megan Ward) realizes that their mysterious disappearances are linked to ARCADE. She must battle the game, alone. Too bad she's never been very good at games... PUPPET MASTER Alex Whitaker, played by Paul Le Mat ("Melvin and Howard", "The Burning Bed"), and three other gifted psychics are investigating rumors that the secret of life has been discovered by master puppeteer Andre Toulon, played by William Hickey ("Prizzi's Honor", "The Name of the Game"). But the psychics quickly discover Toulon's secret of death in the form of five killer puppets -- each one uniquely qualified for murder and mayhem. Together, they're an army of skilled assassins, diabolically programmed to guard the deadly secrets of the Puppet Master. Subspecies Deep within the heart of Transylvania, a dark power from the past has resurfaced, and three beautiful young research students are caught in the midst of a supernatural battle for control of the vampire kingdom. Blood is the tie that binds the good Stefan (Michael Watson) and the evil Radu (Anders Hove), vampire brothers reunited by the death of their father, King Vlad (Angus Scrimm). Radu creates an army of hellish creatures of the night-subspecies-to help him in his wicked quest. Stefan has love on his side as Michelle (Laura Tate), one of the students, joins him in the desperate fight to save the kingdom from the terrifying rule of Radu. Trancers III The best of the Trancers series. A time traveling cop from the future, Jack Deth, is taken back to the past. He is given the task of destroying the Trancer program before it has a chance to get out of control which could send the world into a state of chaos and war.

    <Description>1962 UNCLE WETHBEE'S NEW YORK WEATHER ALMANAC - WITH TEX ANTOINE - PUBLISHED BY CON EDISON Rembember Tex Antoine and Uncle Wethbee? If you lived in the New York City area in the 1950's and 60's you certainly should! Tex was the weatherman on NBC Channel 4, sponsored by Con Edison (Consolidated Edison Power &amp; Light), and Uncle Wethbee was his "magnetic" cartoon sidekick. Unk's large bald head was on a large board, and Tex would add magnetized hair, mustaches, hats, scarves, etc., depending on the forecast (Did you know that each of Unk's garments or hairstyles had a different weather meaning? - Find out what they were in this great little booklet). This booklet measures 5 1/2" x 8 1/4" and has 30 pages (including covers) chock full of information about weather, monthly weather almanac, Con Edison ads, a picture of the late Tex and facsimile signature. Tex was famous, or infamous, for showing up on the air three sheets to the wind, and was once suspended for adivising women rape victims to "lie back and enjoy it."

    <Description>Jodorowsky's THE HOLY MOUNTAIN (1975) Directed by: Alejandro Jodorowsky Produced by: Abkco films Rating: USA: R Language: English Runtime: 114 mins. Sound Mix: Mono It doesn't get stranger than this. We follow a Christ-like figure through parades of flayed and crucified lambs, frogs and lizards dressed as priests and conquistadors trampling a model Mayan city, a hall full of life-size plaster replicas of the main character; eventually he is pulled from this chaos by a guru-figure, played by Jodorowsky himself_ people from other planets embark on a quest to find the Holy Mountain. They plan to attain godhood by murdering the monks of the mountain. Is that all clear? Even people who love El Topo are often cool to The Holy Mountain because it's 'too weird.' In English with Japanese subtitles. 114m. This video tape copy is sourced from a Japanese Laser Disc. Hard case and Japanese video tape color artwork included. Winning Bidder adds $5 for US postage International postage will vary Payment options: PAYPAL, Money Orders.</Description>

    <Description>Here's a RARE chance to see SLAYER live with John Dette on drums during the UNDISPUTED ATTITUDE TOUR in 1996. This show is from some club in California (perhaps you know where), and features remarkable amateur 2 camera recording which has been seamlessly spliced together into what can only be described as a "near-professional" recording! One camera is on each side of the room, above the crowd--GREAT close-ups! The picture and sound are absolutely top notch as far as non-pros go. Definitely EXCELLENT quality here. Full set, approx. 90 minutes. High bidder must add $3.50 for shipping/handling. Payment must be made in MONEY ORDER FORM ONLY, and received by the seller within TEN days of auction's end, or negative feedback wil result immediately. HONEST BIDDERS ONLY!!! THANK YOU!

    <Description>This video is new. Plastic been removed. Starring Lucille Ball, Beatrice Arthur, Bruce Davison, Joyce Van Patten, Kirby Furlong and Robert Preston. She throws parties for every occasion- or nonoccasion- that comes to mind. Circles the globe and files high on cardboard moons. Gallops to victory in a fox hunt the first time she ever mounts a horse. She's Mame Dennis, one of the most beloved stage and screen characters of the last 30 years. And Mame, the 1974 film edition of the 1966 Broadway musical smash, is the latest- and most glittering- appearance of the madcap for whom " life is a banquet. " Playing Mame is another well-loved lady. In her final theatrical film, the late Lucille Ball invested Mame with the glamour that inspired photography experts to dub her " Technicolor Tessie " for her alluring blues eyes and gorgeous, open face. A former Goldwyn Girl from early movie musicals, Lucy's right in step with a high-kicking chorus and right on target with punchliness and pratfalls. On hand from New York original are TV Golden Girl Beatrice Arthur, delightfully reprising her Tony Award-winning role as venomously vampy Vera Charles; Jane Connell as the ever-befuddled governess Agnes Gooch; and two of Broadway's best magic-makers: chorographer Onna White and the three-time Tony-winning director Gene Saks. Joining the club as Mame's husband Beauregard, The Music Man's Robert Preston sings the liting " Loving You, " written especially for the film by Jerry Herman ( Hello, Dolly! La Cage aux Folles ). His tunes for Mame, from the uptempo " It's Today " and " We Need a Little Christmas " to pensive " My Best Girl " and " If He Walked into My Life, " rank among Broadway's best. So light the candles, get the ice out, roll the rug up. And be sure to invite Mame. We do NOT participate in any credit card or pay through programs. Personal checks will take five to seven days to clear the bank. Money Orders ( video will be mailed out within two wotking days once M.O. received. ) Winning bidder pay S&amp;H of $3.75 USPS.

    <Description>This is a rare and beautiful, lavishly illustrated episode guides to that classic television show "The Avengers." Published by Huitieme Art in 1990 under the name "Chapeau Melon et Bottes de Cuir", the text is in French (it was written by Alain Carraze and Jean-Luc Putheaud) although episode titles are in English. The true appeal of this book, however, are the amazing color and black and white photos, which cover episodes from the entire run of the show, from ground breaker Honor Blackman ("Goldfinger's" Pussy Galore) to the unforgettable Diana Rigg to Linda Thorson and Ab Fab's Joanna Lumley, and of course, the wonderful Patrick MacNee. In excellent condition, including an unblemished dust jacket, this is a must for fans of the series. It'll bring back every memory--even if you don't speak French! Just $19.95--no reserve! See my other listings for similar books on "The Prisoner" and "Secret Agent." Priority mail shipping including insurance is $7.55. I prefer Paypal but also accept Billpoint/eBay Payments, money orders and cashiers checks only.</Description>

    <Description>New Page 1 Happy Holidays Everyone! This is a Blockbuster Previewed Movie and it is in very good condition. MOVIE Homeboy Alternate Title: Los Angeles de Carlitos -- Release Year: 1988 Cast: Mickey Rourke, Christopher Walken, Debra Feuer, Thomas Quinn, Kevin Conway, Anthony Alda Director: Michael Seresin Categories: Drama Rated: R (Violence, Brief Nudity, Adult Situations, Questionable for Children, Explicit Language, Profanity ) Running Time: 118 minutes SYNOPSIS Johnny Walker (Mickey Roarke) is a punch-drunk and alcoholic cowboy pugilist who gives boxing one last shot in Asbury Park, New Jersey. He meets Wesley Pendergrass (Christopher Walken), the smooth-talking hood who tries to talk Johnny into helping in the heist of a jewelry store. Johnny considers the offer but elects to enter the ring to help Ruby (Debra Feuer) and her financially troubled arcade with the prize money. He agrees to the bout despite the fact that a blow to his fractured temple bone could kill him. Plodding, pretentious, and cliche-ridden, Walken's performance is the highlight of this grim film. Roarke sued to stop the release of the feature, claiming that the money and creative control promised to him was never delivered. Music is provided by Eric Clapton and Michael Kamen. ~ Dan Pavlides, All Movie Guide Buy now and get your Items by Christmas.... *** TERMS*** *Please direct all questions to smrtdsgn1@aol.com *Shipping is set at $5.00 and I'm sorry but I am unable to give multiple item shipping discounts at this time.

    <Description>I just have the one for sale, she (Whistlers Mother?) is signed at the base of her chair. J.B.copyright. She looks like she is Bronze, but I actually think she is plaster or chalk and is painted to look like some type of metal. She is in really fine shape except for the top of her hand is chipped by her thumb area. An easy fix. She really is cool, if you are into Art Deco or the mission style of furnishing. Buyer to pay sh&amp;i. She is heavy, I am guessing about 3-4 pounds. Payment of check or money order accepted within 7 days of auction end. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!
