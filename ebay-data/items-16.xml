    <Description>You are bidding on the 1984 VHS movie Titled "FITZCARRALDO" Starring KLAUS KINSKI. This is a must have for your video library. The Tape and Original Cover are in EXCELLENT condition. "This powerfully majestic film tells the story of a man obsessed building an opera house in the middle of the Peruvian jungle. In order to fund the project, he conceives the idea of pulling a steamboat over a mountain and into a river tributary where he can achieve a monopoly in the rubber trading business. Director Werner Herzog returns to the exotic locales and obsessive themes of previous works in his Amazon masterpiece, FITZCARRALDO. Klaus Kinski gives a terrifying and determined portrayal of mad genius Fitzcarraldo, whose twin goals of making a fortune off the Amazon rubber trade and bringing an opera house to the jungle give the film its crushing centerpiece--the maniacal leader_s Sisyphean efforts at hauling a gigantic steamship over a mountain bank. The single-minded and wickedly energetic Fitzcarraldo moves mountains (and a boat) with his will and along the way acts out a stunning and emotional battle between man and nature, as in the similarly themed Herzog/Kinski collaboration AGUIRRE, THE WRATH OF GOD. Herzog_s razor-sharp attention to the minutiae of both Fitzcarraldo_s madness and the jungle_s corresponding apathy and enormity makes the film a breathtaking metaphor for civilization_s impact on the natural world. The documentary style of the film (the cast and crew actually hauled the boat over the mountain) gives the tale an urgency and suspense that, combined with Kinski_s bravado performance and Herzog_s striking sense of landscape, make FITZCARRALDO an unforgettable experience." I will accept Money Orders, and Mastercard/Visa through PAYPAL. Shipping &amp; Handling is $3.00 in the United States and variable, internationally, based upon location. Good Luck!

John Carpenter's 3-Pack: Vampires / Christine / Starman Vampires: In the blood-chilling tradition of Halloween and Village of the Damned comes John Carpenter's unique vision of the ultimate killing machines, Vampires. "Forget everything you've ever known about vampires," warns Jack Crow (James Woods), the leader of Team Crow, a relentless group of mercenary vampire slayers. When Master Vampire Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith) decimates Jack's entire team, Crow and the sole team survivor, Montoya (Daniel Baldwin), set out in pursuit. Breaking all the rules, Crow and Montoya take one of Valek's victims hostage. The beautiful but unlucky prostitute (Sheryl Lee) is their sole psychic link to Valek, and through her senses they will track down the leader of the undead. As Valek nears the climax of his 600-year search for the Berziers Cross, Jack and the new Team Crow do everything humanly possible to prevent him from possessing the only thing that can grant him and all vampires the omnipotent power to walk in the daylight. Christine: She was born in Detroit. on an automobile assembly line. But she is no ordinary automobile. Deep within her chassis lies an unholy presence. She is Christine - a red and white 1958 Plymouth Fury whose unique standard equipment includes an evil, indestructible vengeance that will destroy anyone in her way. She seduces 17-year-old Arnie Cunningham (Keith Gordon) who becomes consumed with passion for her sleek, rounded, chrome-laden body. She demands his complete and unquestioned devotion and when outsiders seek to interfere, they become the victims of Christine's horrifying wrath. John Carpenter brings Stephen King's best-selling novel to life in this chilling thriller. Starman: Director John Carpenter presents a romantic science fiction odyssey starring Jeff Bridges as an innocent alien from a distant planet who learns what it means to be a man in love. When his spacecraft is shot down over Wisconsin, Starma (Bridges) arrives at the remote cabin of a distraught young widow, Jenny Hayden (Karen Allen), and clones the form of her dead husband. The alien convinces Jenny to drive him to Arizona, explaining that if he isn't picked up by his mothership in three days, he'll die. Hot on their trail are government agents, intent on capturing the alien, dead or alive. En route, Starman demonstrates the power of universal love, while Jenny rediscovers her human feelings for passion.

    <Description>Felicity (1979). Starring Glory Annen, Marilyn Rodgers, Christopher Milne, Joni Flynn. Directed by John D. Lamond. This erotic film begins at a girl's finishing school. Felicity (Annen, who looks like Traci Lords from certain angels) starts to feel feisty. She then journeys around with friends in search of passion. If you can't figure out the rest this movie is not for you. One of those films that might make you angry because s#@t like this just doesn't happen. Erotic but NON-pornographic. Extremely Rare Uncut 90 min. NC-17 version. Contains full frontal nudity. May appeal to those who appreciate David Hamilton's photography. VHS comes in a plastic case with a color insert. Please note that Felicity is the girl in the backround in the photo below. The girl in front is her Asian guide. IF YOU HAVE A QUESTION PLEASE ASK BEFORE NOT AFTER YOU BID. Shipping is $3.60 ($5.00 Canada. $9.00 Overseas). Paypal and money order accepted. Paypal users: Please wait for the bill.

    <Description>Happiness The search for happiness connects lonely lives in this subversively funny new film from Todd Solondz, director of "Welcome to the Dollhouse." Meet three sisters at the center of a struggle with the secret demons of middle class perfection. There's Joy (Jane Adams) who is rebounding from a break up with her latest loser boyfriend (Jon Lovitz), Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle), a glamorous writer looking for drama in a relationship with a slovenly obscene phone caller (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and then there's Trish (Cynthia Stevenson), the housewife who appears to have it all, including a shrink husband (Dylan Baker) who has an unnatural obsession which he manages to keep secret from his family and friends. This film won the Cannes International Critics Prize in 1998 and was on nearly every critic's Top Ten list. Producer: Ted Hope and Christine Vachon Director: Todd Solondz Starring: Jane Adams, Elizabeth Ashley, Dylan Baker, Lara Flynn Boyle, Ben Gazzara, Jared Harris, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Louise Lasser, Jon Lovitz, Camryn Manheim, Rufus Read, and Cynthia Stevenson Buyer pays $4 shipping &amp; handling charge. Combined shipping available for an additional $2 per DVD if bidder successfully wins more than one of my auctions. Optional insurance available for $1.10 and is recommended. If insurance is not added I will not be responsible for items lost/damaged in the mail. Money orders and cashier's checks accepted. Paypal payment also allowed if Buyer's Ebay rating is greater than 10. Payment must be made within 10 days of auction or item will be relisted and negative feedback given. This DVD is in very good condition; however there is no cover art/inserts included. This title is currently selling for about $18 in Half.com's used section, so take advantage of my low Buy It Now price while it lasts! Good luck, and thanks for looking!</Description>

    <Description>CHASING DOGMA Jay &amp; Silent Bob LTD HC SIGNED BID WITH CONFIDENCE View our eBay Feedback for testimony of quality packing and representation of items. To help describe why you need the BEAUTIFUL, HARDCOVER, SIGNED Chasing Dogma , we seek the words of the prophet himself, the sage and wondrous Jay, to describe the goings on he and his Jedi master bud, Silent Bob, face within the book's confines: "So's we don't get sued, I just wanna remind you knee-jerk f*cks out there that this is a work of parody. Doogie doesn't really make porn... Not that I know of anyway. And Fred Rogers is probably a saint of a guy. Federal Wildlife Marshals aren't nearly as stupid as they're portrayed here, and John Hughes has never led anyone to believe that Shermer really exists. And I never... NEVER ... jerked no guys off. Snoogans." If those pearls of wisdom are not yet enough to convert the unbelievers to this fine piece, which not only has combined the SPECTACULAR JAY &amp; SILENT BOB MINI-SERIES, seen for the FIRST TIME IN FULL COLOR, but also has EXCLUSIVE SKETCHBOOK PAGES, and an AMAZING gallery of every cover for the whole mini-series INCLUDING VARIANTS... to those unbelievers I can only say two words to help you convert: PORN STARS!!! How can you pass this up?!? It was penned by the UNEQUALLED KEVIN SMITH HIMSELF, and fits perfectly into the NEW JERSEY MYTHOLOGY that began with CLERKS, and has spun all the way to DOGMA! It actually has cameos from each and every movie, from RANDAL to TRISH, and links the storyline from the restaurant scene in CHASING AMY to the triumphant save in DOGMA! Plus, it has AN INTRODUCTION FROM GOD HERSELF, ALANIS MORISSETTE!!! (At least, she plays God in the movie...) Oh! Did I mention this monster is SIGNED BY KEVIN SMITH (who not only plays Silent Bob, but is secretly a Ninja Master), JASON MEWES (who plays Jay, and is kind to kitties and puppies), and DUNCAN FEGRADO (the artist, who has threatened my life if I mention the "Stripper Incident"). This mad monkey SOLD OUT at $70.00 retail and was LIMITED TO ONLY 5000 COPIES!! The pix you see are from a copy we opened for ourselves, but yours will be STILL SHRINKWRAPPED!!!

The note that came with this picture reads "This was a shower present given to me by our sorority House, Mother, Wedding present was Pewter lamp. I can only tell you I am guessing it was from the 30s based upon the estate it came from could be much older. The artist Compte Calix (born at Lyon in 1813 was honored with Salon medals in 1844, 1857 and 1863. This is in very good condition was well taken care of and stored well the only thing to note is black paper on back is worn at edges. 9.5" x 6.5". . $4.50 shipping.

    <Description>"Crazy in Alabama", 1998, Columbia, directed by Antonio Banderas, based on the novel by Mark Childress; starring Melanie Griffith, David Morse, Lucas Black, Meatloaf (Meat Loaf), and Rod Steiger. There is a faint crease in the poster from top to bottom about 5 inches from the right edge, and a small 1/2" tear about 1/3 of the way down on the left edge. I will be using buy-it-now on all of my auctions for in-time Christmas delivery. I will be shipping DAILY until December 23rd!!! I have come into a collection of about 200 theatrical movie posters which I am listing this week. Descriptions are short, so feel free to email me for any details. Some photos are taken at a slight angle to reduce glare. They are all original one-sheets, double-sided, 27" wide by 38-40" tall; designed for normal display or use in a theatrical light-box unless otherwise noted (about 15 of them are single-sided "standard" box posters). They are all in very nice condition with occasional light creasing, tiny tears, or corner crimps. Any tears over 1/4", visible creases, or other defects will be noted in the specific description. Shipping in the continental US can be by media mail at $4.50 in a shipping tube, or priority mail at $6.50 in a shipping tube. I accept PayPal, money orders, checks (10 day hold before shipping), well-concealed cash, and BidPay. I *DO* combine shipping for multiple purchases, so check out the other posters in this collection! Additional shipping for multiple purchases will be negligible, I can ship up to 4 posters at no additional cost.

    <Description>Nice pair of teaspoons marked on back "1847 Rogers Bros IS Adoration". They are both in nice condition, no dents, dings, or monograms. Light surface marks from use. Spoons are 6" long. I'm sorry the picture quality isn't better. The spoons are a lot nicer looking than the picture shows. I have other items listed in this pattern and will combine. Payment Terms Shipping and Handling charges are $3.50 for continental USA. Insurance is optional but HIGHLY recommended at $1.10 per $50 of item cost. PayPal and Money Orders accepted for fast shipment. (Usually next day). Checks held minimum 10 business days. Payment is due within ten (10) days of auction close .

    <Description>IT IS A JAMES BOND 7 DVD SET VOL 1 - OOP NEW FACTORY SEALED SHIPPING IS BY U.P.S:CANADA $10 U.S.A. $12 PAYMENT IS BY PAYPAL ONLY (888)221-1161 WWW.PAYPAL.COM THE FEATURES: The Best Volume Of The James Bond Collection Seven films. Four Bonds. One set. This sprawling collection surveys over 30 years of James Bond skullduggery, from the cold war tensions of the 1960s to the international free-for-all of the present. Sean Connery remains the coolest of the Bonds, a ruthless agent with dry martini wit and a way with the women, and in Goldfinger his steely presence helped forge the Bond formula of tongue-in-cheek wit, wondrous secret agent toys created by Q, and megalomaniac supervillains bent on world destruction. Thunderball upped the Bond ante with the most ambitious adventure--and budget--to date. Roger Moore brought an altogether lighter tone to 007 with Live and Let Die, softening Connery's rough edges with a more romantic persona as the films became even more exotic. After a brief digression into outer space, For Your Eyes Only returned Bond to globetrotting high adventure and teamed him with his most endearing ally (Topol as a gregarious smuggler). Timothy Dalton made his second and final appearance as Bond in Licence to Kill, the toughest of the Bond films since Connery's early efforts. Though not a fan favorite, it's a sleek, solid adventure with an edge missing from the Moore pictures. Pierce Brosnan is the latest to take on 007's licence to kill, combining the best of Connery's cool and Moore's humor. GoldenEye is the best Bond film in years, a grand globetrotting adventure with lovely Bond girls and a tough new M (Judy Dench). Tomorrow Never Dies doesn't recapture that magic mix of action, gadgetry, and romance, but does feature the first Bond girl to match 007 blow for blow: Hong Kong action superstar Michelle Yeoh. Taken together, this set is a veritable cross-section of the many faces of James Bond. All that's missing is George Lazenby. Do I hear a nomination for set 2? BOND DVD SET DETAILS: Region 1 encoding (US and Canada only) Commentary by the directors of each film, with cast and crew The James Bond Giftset Volume 1 Includes the Following: _ Licence to Kill _ For Your Eyes Only _ Tomorrow Never Dies _ Goldfinger _ A Live and Let Die _ Thunderball _ GoldenEye There are many extras on these DVDS... too much to name, but here is what is included below... Trailers, Deleted Scenes, Collectible Making-Of Booklets, Making-Of Documentaries .</Description>

    <Description>A HERB FREED FILM HAUNTS COLOR * MGM VIDEO * 97 MINUTES * R * 1977 __________________________ RARE OOP VHS __________________________ SCAN OF BOX BELOW FEATURING: ALDO RAY MAY BRITT &amp; CAMERON MITCHELL __________________ THE TAPE &amp; ITS BOX ARE IN GREAT CONDITION! BID EARLY! BID OFTEN! THE STORY: Despite bearing the earmarks of a cheap slasher outing, this quirky little thriller emerges as a surprisingly original murder mystery with some well-executed twists. May Britt (formerly Mrs. Sammy Davis, Jr.) plays a seemingly innocent farm girl (with more than a few toys rolling loose in the attic) convinced that her slovenly uncle (played by a delightfully grumpy Cameron Mitchell) is the man responsible for the grisly scissor-murders of several local girls. The validity of her suspicions has little bearing on the story's outcome, as the plot takes a rather unexpected turn halfway through. This seedy but fun horror film is buoyed by Britt's enjoyably loony performance, coupled with the cranky antics of Mitchell and Aldo Ray as the town's drunken sheriff. ================================================== RARE ================================================== A woman's perception of time becomes hopelessly distorted when a series of grisly murders occur in the small country town in which she lives. An intriguing tale of terror and possession. ================================================== KINGCUTIE LOVES YOU!

    <Description>This is an autographed shooting script from the Buffy The Vampire Slayer episode "The Body". It's a copy of the original so the autographs ARE COPIES AND NOT THE ORIGINALS!! A "shooting script" is very different from a transcript. A shooting script includes the cast list, set list, camera angles, off screen items, etc. This is what is given to the industry. It's 51 pages. The original was 3 hole punched but this copy has been placed in a "velo" bind with a clear plastic cover to protect it. This will make a **GREAT** christmas gift for any Buffy fan!!

    <Description>Hard to find factory sealed video (VHS) of the early 60's television special "HOLLYWOOD MELODY" sponsored by Chrysler. The celebration of the music of ARTHUR FREED's Hollywood Musicals starred SHIRLEY JONES, HOWARD KEEL, RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN, NANETTE FABRAY, YVETTE MIMIUX and JULIET PROWSE and was hosted by DONALD O'CONNOR. Noted for writing the score for 1929's "Broadway Melody", ARTHUR FREED had a fruitful career in the motion picture industry first as a lyricist (a few of his songs are "Singin' in the Rain", "Pagan Love Song", "All I Do is Dream of You", "I Cried For You", "Alone" and "You are My Lucky Star") and later as the most successful producer in the history of the Movie Musical. Among his many productions were "BABES IN ARMS", "ZIEGFELD FOLLIES", "THE WIZARD OF OZ", "FOR ME AND MY GAL", "GIRL CRAZY", "MEET ME IN ST. LOUIS", "THE HARVEY GIRLS", "TILL THE CLOUDS ROLL BY", "GOOD NEWS", "EASTER PARADE", "WORDS AND MUSIC", "ON THE TOWN", "ROYAL WEDDING", "ANNIE GET YOUR GUN", "SHOW BOAT", "AN AMERICAN IN PARIS", "BRIGADOON", "KISMET", "IT'S ALWAYS FAIR WEATHER", "THE BAND WAGON", "SILK STOCKINGS", "GIGI" and "BELLS ARE RINGING" ... The 1962 NBC program begins with host DONALD O'CONNOR sharing some insight into the importance of Arthur Freed in the emergence of the Hollywood musical. HOWARD KEEL follows a bevy of bombshells in singing the title song from 1929's "Broadway Melody" and NANETTE FABRAY sings "If I Had a Talking Picture of You" from 1929's "Sunny Side Up". Next, HOWARD KEEL sings the lovely JEROME KERN and OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN 2nd melody "Lovely To Look At" from the 1952 film of the same name followed by a radiant SHIRLEY JONES singing the Gershwin's "Love Walked In" from the 1938 movie musical "Goldwyn Follies". DONALD O'CONNOR performs a lively tap to "Forty-Second Street" before he introduces "TV's Dr. Kildare", RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN (announcing it as his first musical TV appearance). Richard Chamberlain introduces several sketches including a comic scene of Opening Night at the "Frolics 1931" with DONALD O'CONNOR, NANETTE FABRAY, HOWARD KEEL and JULIET PROWSE followed by a scene from the college musical "Varsity Stomp" with HOWARD KEEL and SHIRLEY JONES. Next, SHIRLEY JONES and RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN sing the beautiful duet "I Love New York in June" followed by a series of dance numbers by JULIET PROWSE including the classic HAROLD ARLEN melody "Get Happy" made famous by JUDY GARLAND. A campy salute to the movie musicals of JEANETTE MACDONALD and NELSON EDDY follows as NANETTE FABRAY is backed by what appears to be a cast of thousands. SHIRLEY JONES, DONALD O'CONNOR, NANETTE FABRAY, HOWARD KEEL and JULIET PROWSE perform a medley of tunes from ARTHUR FREED musicals (finishing with a rousing rendition of "Singin' in the Rain") followed by YVETTE MIMIUX hosting a screening of scenes from various Freed films including "Meet Me in St. Louis" (JUDY GARLAND), "On the Town" (GENE KELLY &amp; FRANK SINATRA), "Ziegfeld Follies" (FRED ASTAIRE &amp; GENE KELLY), "An American in Paris" (GENE KELLY &amp; LESLIE CARON) and "Gigi" (LOUIS JOURDON). Next, ARTHUR FREED is introduced and briefly discusses his career with MGM before introducing songs from his upcoming film projects (several of which came to fruition without Freed). First, RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN sings a couple lines of "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World" from Billy Rose's "JUMBO" followed by NANETTE FABRAY and "A Grand Night for Singing" from RICHARD RODGERS and OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN 2nd's "STATE FAIR". This is followed by a couple lines of "Love Makes the World Go Round" from "CARNIVAL" sung beautifully by SHIRLEY JONES, "Tonight" from "WEST SIDE STORY" by HOWARD KEEL, "Put On a Happy Face" from "BYE BYE BIRDIE" sung by JULIET PROWSE and finally "Seventy-Six Trombones" from MEREDITH WILLSON's "THE MUSIC MAN" performed by DONALD O'CONNOR ... This hard to find black and white pre-recorded video (approx. 1 hour) is new and factory sealed and comes complete with the vintage Chrysler TV ads. The video and audio quality are excellent! ... NO RESERVE! ... Buyer pays $2.25 media rate or $4.00 Priority Mail in the U.S. (Insurance is optional but available only with Priority shipping).

    <Description>CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON Chow Yun-Fat - Michelle Yeoh Directed by Ang Lee Martial Arts Violence and Some Sexuality www.filmratings.com - www.mpaa.org Hong Kong wuxia films , or martial arts fantasies, traditionally squeeze poor acting, slapstick humor, and silly story lines between elaborate fight scenes in which characters can literally fly. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has no shortage of breathtaking battles, but it also has the dramatic soul of a Greek tragedy and the sweep of an epic romance. This is the work of director Ang Lee, who fell in love with movies while watching wuxia films as a youngster and made Crouching Tiger as a tribute to the form. To elevate the genre above its B-movie roots and broaden its appeal, Lee did two important things. First, he assembled an all-star lineup of talent, joining the famous Asian actors Chow Yun-fat and Michelle Yeoh with the striking, charismatic newcomer Zhang Ziyi. Behind the scenes, Lee called upon cinematographer Peter Pau ( The Killer, The Bride with White Hair ) and legendary fight choreographer Yuen Wo-ping, best known outside Asia for his work on The Matrix . Second, in adapting the story from a Chinese pulp-fiction novel written by Wang Du Lu, Lee focused not on the pursuit of a legendary sword known as "The Green Destiny," but instead on the struggles of his female leads against social obligation. In his hands, the requisite fight scenes become another means of expressing the individual spirits of his characters and their conflicts with society and each other.

    <Description>QUEER AS FOLK US Gay Interest Season 1 DVD Queer As Folk - The Complete U.S. First Season (Showtime) (2001) Based on the British television series of the same name, Showtime's QUEER AS FOLK quickly became as big a hit in the US as the original was abroad. Focusing on the lives of three gay men (Michael, an insecure 29 year-old, Brian, an ad executive who isn't into relationships, and Justin, a wide-eyed and innocent 17 year old) and their circle of friends, the series has earned both critical praise and scorn for unflinching look at gay life, love, and sex. Whatever one may think of the show's sexual content, QUEER AS FOLK is undeniably a compelling and thought provoking series. Stars Hal Sparks, Gale Harold, Randy Harrison, Michelle Clunie, Thea Gill, Scott Lowell, Peter Paige, Chris Potter. Diretced by Russell Mulcahy. DVD FEATURES: 6-disc Box Set (22 Episodes), Scene introductions by Hal Sparks, Behind the scenes outtakes, "Meet The Folk" section containing biographies, interviews and character profiles, Season 2 Sneak Preview, Music Photo Gallery, Episodic Index, previews &amp; summaries, Approximately 3 hrs of special edition episodes &amp; commentaries, DVD Rom weblink, Widescreen anamorphic format.

    <Description>This is an official, rare, promo POSTER (made to look like a polaroid picture) from the brilliant, psychological thriller, MEMENTO, starring Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano and directed by Christopher Nolan. This POSTER shows a fairly disturbing image of Guy Pearce (as seen as an actual polaroid picture in the film). This promo poster measures approximately 16" x 20". These were distributed in limited quantities at a local movie theatre. MEMENTO is the best film of 2001 and unlike any film you have seen before. This is a wonderful rare "memento" from MEMENTO. This exclusive color poster is in mint condition and has never been displayed. Bottom reads: "OTNEMEM.COM" (which is the title backwards). Picture does not do this exclusive poster justice! Actual image on this POSTER is clear and unmistakable. Check out my excellent feedback rating and bid with confidence on this rare promo. Don't miss out on this rare item that can't be bought in any store! This will look great next to your other movie posters!! High bidder pays $4.50 for priority shipping and handling. (Poster will be neatly rolled and safely shipped in a tube or appropriate box.) Insurance is optional. MONEY ORDERS OR PAYPAL PREFERRED.

    <Description>Here are four classic '60s episodes of four different TV series hosted by four fab British gal singers! First is a segment of Dusty Springfield's BBC TV series, with guest stars Tom Jones (who performs "Show Me" and duets with Dusty on another number), and Scott Walker in what is probably his first solo (post-Walker Brothers) TV appearance, singing "Mathilde" (from his first solo album). Dusty herself performs "Get Ready," "All I See Is You," "Nowhere To Run," an Irish folk song, and "Everybody Needs Somebody To Love." As one of the few extant segments of Dusty's TV series, this episode was heavily excerpted in the French and Saunders "Full Circle" special in 1994................. Next is an episode of Lulu's series, with guest stars the Everly Brothers; they perform "Bye Bye Love," and duet with Lulu on "Walk Right Back." Lulu serves up the Judy Garland chestnut "The Trolley Song" (made famous again in the 80s on Saturday Night Live by the Sweeney Sisters). Also featured is the dour British comic Les Dawson; he, too, sings a duet with Lulu!............. Then, a segment of Cilla Black's show, with guest stars Sandie Shaw and Cliff Richard, each performing a Eurovision winner; Sandie seems uneasy as she runs through "Puppet on a String," while Cliff enthusiastically glides through "Congratulations." Sandie also sings the Bee Gees number "Words," and Cliff does a duet with Cilla. And, of course, Ms. Black opens the show with her John Lennon-Paul McCartney-penned theme song "Step Inside Love" ............... Finally, an episode of THE SANDIE SHAW SUPPLEMENT, with guest star John Walker of the Walker Brothers (who performs "By The Time I Get to Phoenix"). Sandie sings "Route 66," "Do You Know The Way to San Jose," and "Girl Don't Come," and a duet with John Walker on "Homeward Bound." ............ AND, as if THAT weren't enough, the tape is filled out with bonus 60s TV appearances by all four of the aforementioned divas. Total running time is just about two hours. Buyer pays shipping.

    <Description>This movie is out of print; BRAND NEW, STILL SEALED! Known as "the gutter film," this out-of-print video was filmed in alleys, gutters, laundromats and various deserted areas around Baltimore, MD. This John Waters original stars the thoroughly luscious Divine as a blonde bombshell - decked out from head to toe in gold capri pants and halter top, along with a pair of gold six inch heels ~ and she's in all her trashy splendor ~ chewing gum, driving a 59 Cadillac convertible and gives lots of that Divine wiggle. Outrageous is the name of the game with foot fetishists, nude hitchhikers, a mental institution inhabited by topless dancers ~ it's all here in MONDO TRASHO! This tape is Vhs NTSC format, meaning it is for VCR's in North America. Buyer pays shipping of $3.50 for air mail within North America.

    <Description>___ Don't Forget to go check out my EBAY STORE. ___ NEW DVD * Of Mice &amp; Men * Randy Quaid This DVD is BRAND NEW &amp; SEALED. John Steinbeck's famed novel receives a stunning adaptation in this gripping, powerful feature film. Lenny (Randy Quaid) and George (Robert Blake) are two itinerant ranch hands on the run. Lenny is a strong but pathetically retarded child-man who has accidentally killed a woman; George is his lifelong friend, devoted to protecting Lenny from his innocent but calamitous mistakes. Lenny and George find unexpected work in the fields of rancher Jackson (Pat Hingle), and they begin to dream of better days on a spread of their own, which they will buy with Jackson's wages. But the rancher's son Curley (Ted Neeley) mercilessly torments Lenny, and Curley's voluptuous wife Mae (Cassie Yates) playfully entices the weak-witted giant--leading to an act of unintentional violence with tragic consequences for Lenny and George.

    <Description>SEE MY OTHER AUCTIONS-I DO NOT SELL REPRODUCTIONS-ONLY ORIGINAL AND RE-RELEASE POSTERS AND LOBBIES! Original posters are the most desirable to collectors, but unfortunately, the older and more popular the film, the costlier the posters can be. Horror and sci-fi films from the 30s to the 50s are generally some of the most collectible due to their popularity and rarity. Any original, and even re-release posters from these periods that show the main actor(s)-Karloff, Lugosi, Chaney, Lorre, Price, etc. or the main monster from the film, are generally the more expensive items and hardest to find. My auctions will most often be for lobby cards, but I also have various other posters and memorabilia. You can find reproduction lobby cards and posters in many auctions, and for the budget minded person who only wants to see paper from their favorite films, these should suffice. But serious collectors only settle for the real thing. I ONLY offer AUTHENTIC, ORIGINAL OR RE-RELEASE POSTERS-NO REPRODUCTIONS, so bid with CONFIDENCE. EMPIRE OF THE ANTS Starring ROBERT LANSING! 11X14 Any GLARE on image shown is NOT due to a flaw on the poster, but is the result of the reflected camera flash.

    <Description>POIROT*3VHS*Set10*Agatha Christie*Sealed*NEW* Description This is a brand new factory sealed 3 VHS Collection. This set comes in a great shelf-case! I never deal in Bootlegs or Screeners! NTSC format for play in USA and Canada. A suspicious suicide, a well-staged kidnapping, and a fatal fall--none of these are what they appear to be in this three-tape installment of episodes from the Agatha Christie's Poirot series. While true collectors will devour the whole set, newcomers to the series will appreciate "Murder in the Mews." This plot of murder made to look like suicide has as many twists as an intricate Celtic knot and keeps the viewer guessing both whodunit and why until the final moments--it's tempting to watch this one a second time as soon as it's over. Unfortunately, "The Adventure of Johnnie Waverly" and "Four and Twenty Blackbirds" have motives so obvious, it's almost tedious to wait an hour for these cases to be solved. Of course, David Suchet's performance as the Belgian detective holds up through all three episodes, and Hugh Fraser is marvelously dim as Poirot's affable companion, Captain Hastings Payment and Shipping IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE WINNING BIDDER!

    <Description>The Anunnciation (VHS) Drama Hungary ? 1984 Color ? 101 minutes Not Rated ? Contains nudity, graphic language and provocative subject matter!. - Viewer discretion advised In Hungarian with English subtitles In the garden of Eden, a nude Adam partakes of the forbidden fruit because he cannot bare to live without Eve, his love. Cast out of Paradise by a wrathful God, the pair looks to beautiful Lucifer to fulfill his promise and grant them the secret knowledge of the trees. So begins The Annunciation, Andras Jeles' stunning, epic account of the dark history of humanity as portrayed entirely by children between 8 and 12 years of age. Photographed against the breathtaking fields, forests, mesas and shores of southern Hungary, The Annunciation sends 12 year -old Adam on an existential odyssey through time and space. He becomes a general in Athens, a crusader in Byzantium, Danton during the French Revolution, and a witness to the plague in London. As guided by a deceptively sweet, ultimately contemptuous Lucifer, Adam confronts an endless procession of Rapists and concubines, betrayal and savagery, mindless cruelty and fanaticism. Superbly photographed, colorfully costumed and stunningly acted, The Annunciation makes Pasolini-like uses of its youthful cast to illustrate the horror and irrationality of our times. THIS MOVIE DOES NOT CONTAIN PORNOGRAPHIC MATERIALS AND MAY BE LAWFULLY SOLD TO AND VIEWED BY MINORS. Shipping is just $5.00 anywhere in the US and Canada International shipping anywhere in the world is $12.50. We accept paypal, we're verified, Money orders and personal check.

    <Description>LARKS ON A STRING DESCRIPTION: From the Academy Award winning directory of CLOSELY WATCHED TRAINS comes a film that was banned until the melt-down of the iron curtain in Europe. LARKS ON A STRING is a witty and bittersweet love-story set in a communist junkyard. While serving time for a desertion and taking steps toward re-education, a rag-tag group of workers unites as a young couple decides to marry and we find that loves rises to the top of the scrapheap.

A word of warning: keep a watchful eye for the secret police who slyly lurk in the background.

    <Description>"Welcome to Twin Peaks, Twin Peaks Access Guide to the Town"..."An unforgettable, in-depth tour of the town that's captured America's imagination! From the writers of "Twin Peaks" and the producer of the Access guides, comes a one-of-a kind book about the town of Twin Peaks. Written with the humor and quirkiness expected of Twin peaks, this guide includes everything from Norma Jennings' cherry pie recipe to the type of tree the Log Lady's log is from to the Double R Diner's Specials for the Week." "The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer"...."read about Laura Palmer's innermost thoughts and intimate secrets". 184 pages. Official publications by Twin Peaks Productions. Both books are in very good condition. Buyer pays shipping, US Priority. Shipping usually takes 2 weeks from the time I receive payment, but may take 4 weeks as I may be called out of town unexpectedly. I ship at the end of each week. Payment by money order. Those who wish to use an internet pay service, Bid Pay is available so that you can use your credit card. I do not accept any other internet payment service. I have had too many personal checks bounce, so would prefer payment by money order or Bid Pay. However, if you must send a personal check, understand that I WILL HOLD THE ORDER FOR 30 DAYS. I can only get to the bank once every 2 weeks, and it often takes several weeks for the check to clear. Payment should be received within 2 weeks. For international buyers: Bid Pay may be more advantageous; or payment needs to be an international money order drawn on a US bank in US dollars (available from a major bank). NOTE: I apologize, but I do not post feedback unless a sale is not completed. Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>Fabulous large softcover edition of "Peter Sellers" by Derek Sylvester. Published by Proteus Publishing of London, England in 1981. From whacky goon of the '50s to international superstar of the '70s, Peter Sellers, the master of mimicry, who himself remained inimitable, has endeared himself to lovers of high comedy everywhere. In this entertaining appraisal, the author examines not only the mainsprings of his unique multi-faceted talent, but aspects of his personality that made for a turbulent and much-publicized private life. It is the performer that is remembered, for Sellers was more than just "The Man of a Thousand Masks", he was an actor that puched the art of comedy in a new direction. Book is in near mint to mint condition with no fading or tears. Over 125 pages with dozens and dozens of photographs from his life and career. All e-mail inquiries welcome.</Description>

    <Description>This quilt was hand made in 1960 by a lady in Ohio ,as an entry in the Ohio State Fair. The quilt won 2 blue ribbons!It was sold as part of her estate in 1992. It is crisp and unused, and has been in storage for it's whole life.The quilt measures a generous 35 x 56 inches, not including the 2 1/2 inch ruffled border around the edge.The front of the quilt is embroidered with the alphabet. There are 28 embroidered blocks with the letter of the alphabet and an embroidered picture of an animal or item that represents that letter. Two of the blocks do not have a letter, but are on the quilt to balance it, I guess.The pictures include:apple, bird,cat,dog,elephant, frog, goose, Humpty Dumpty,ice cream, jack-in-the -box, king, lamb,mouse, nest, owl, pig,queen,rabbit, squirrel, turtle,umbrella,violets,wagon,xylophone,yarn, zebra.These are all done in vibrant cross stitch! I believe the front is machine quilted, the embroidery is hand done, and the ruffled edge is attached to the quilt by machine stitching very close to the edge of the quilt. The ruffled edge is 2 1/2 inches wide, and is double thickness with the raw edges together under the front and back of the quilt, not visible.The material is cotton all around, and the edge and backing are done in blue and white checks.The quilting does not go through to the backing, which is attached to the quilt at the edges next to the ruffle. In mint condition with no soiling, stains, odors,tears, holes, or fraying.This one is the best! A fabulous wall hanging or as a quilt for a lucky, beloved child! Please email with questions prior to bidding. Checks must clear before item ships. Payment MUST be received within 10 days of auction's end. BidPay and Paypal welcome. Please view my other auctions currently running on ebay for more vintage and antique treats! Happy Bidding!!!!!</Description>

Please include $7 for US shipping, international orders will depend on your home country shipping address and will undoubtedly be higher._ Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. _ For Fastest Shipping: US bidders can use Visa/MasterCard with PayPal!

    <Description>This auction is for Dragonball Z Manjin Buu_s reign of terr,r which are episodes 240-249. After the death of Vegeta and supposedly the death of Gohan everyone regroups at the lookout tower to try to figure things out. Meanwhile Manjin Buu and the evil magician Bebi-dee are wrecking havoc on earth and Goku decides that with his time remaining on earth he is not going to allow this to continue. In this saga you will see the training of Goten and Trunks to form the Fusion technique, the training of Gohan by Kiou-shin and Kibit as he learns to use the ancient sword from their home planet and most of all you will see Goku turn Super Sayain level 3 for the first time as he takes on Manjin Buu where both are evenly matched. This auction totals 10 episodes and I_m proud to say that all the episodes are in A quality so the entire saga is in A quality And in Japanese with English subtitles and UNCUT. Please if you have any questions or concerns please E-mail me at Vengefulmind@aol.com. Bid on my other auctions and save of shipping, good luck to everyone and thank you for looking at my auction.

This pillow case will give you many nights of pleasure. The other items in this collection are two handcrafted laminated photo magnets each with a fabulous image on it. These magnets would look incredible hanging any place you have to hang one up. The scan doesn't do justice to this collection, it's much prettier in person.

    <Description>Husbands and Lovers (1991) ( USA NTSC VHS Movie ) Stephen &amp; Alina have a highly unconventional marriage in which they have vowed to be totally honest with each other. When Alina wants to take a lover, Stephen agrees but with the one proviso that she must report back to him all the details of her affair with the rich &amp; sophisticated Paolo. They believe that this kind of honesty will bring them closer &amp; intensify their love for one another. And so, Alina begins her adventure. This is the controversial film that explores the sexual fringe of relationships where desire, obsession &amp; self-destruction come together in an explosive mix that cannot be avoided. 94 min version..
