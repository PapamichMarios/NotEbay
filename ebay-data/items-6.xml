So this is an opportunity Indians have a long history of producing hand made rugs and special talent in reproduction of rugs. After the recent revolution in Iran, many manufacturers and exporters of Persian rugs left the country and immigrated to European and American countries. The migration resulted in the knowledge of European taste and demand as they started a whole new era of producing handmade rugs in new design and fashion. They started reproducing antique Persian rugs in exactly the same fashion and techniques that were hundreds of years old, and surely were able change the trend by offering new production. Due to situations in Iran, most of the production took place in India. Production of Persian designs in particular reproductions of antique Persian rugs captured the American and European markets. One of the main rugs they promoted was the antique Persian Heriz, which have been one of the top names in antique rugs. Antique Heriz rugs are sold in upscale galleries for outrageous prices. Heriz rugs are famous for having soft colors and clear designs. These rugs have been targeted among designers and decorators all over the world. Most have a large central medallion embedded within a lighter field, and the main color scheme of the rug is usually some shade of brick Red. In addition to being decorative and beautiful, Heriz rugs are extremely durable and capable of handling heavy traffic, made to last life time. Unfortunately, not many antique Heriz rugs are around and when they are, you find them with a lot of wear and outrageous prices. These rugs are made of the finest handspun wool on cotton foundation. Heriz rugs bring lots of attraction and decoration to any room, as they can easily compliment your traditional furniture, as well as with modern and contemporary settings. Since they have been fashionable rugs for hundreds of years, they will never go out of fashion and will always maintain their classic spirit, accumulating age and history as they are passed down from generation to generation. _____ Satisfaction Guaranteed _ _ Bid with confidence, if you are not satisfied with your item you may return it within a week for refund less shipping charges.

    <Description>Wonderful Unusual Antique Christmas Tree Ornament - Circa 1930's - 1940's, perhaps even older - A Superb Find! Just in time for the holidays and fresh out of an estate sale in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, Gosla Antiques &amp; Collectibles is pleased to offer this fine hand made Christmas ornament. This lovely ornament measures approximately 10" overall, not counting the wire hook. Lovely chain woven tinsel like metal. Many strands. Ending with colorful pink plastic beads. One of two like this we are listing simultaneously. Excellent condition. We're not positive of the age, but we estimate that they are from the 1920-1940's. Possibly German in origin. This is quite a work of art and would look wonderful on any Christmas tree. We've never seen anything like them. One of several ornaments that we will be listing this week. Shipping this item, very well packaged, anywhere in the continental United States via USPS Priority Mail Service will cost $4.40. Save on shipping costs with multiple auction wins... We'll provide the lucky winning bidder with a toll free number for paying with a credit card.

    <Description>Dept 56 NEV Mill Creek Crossing FREE SHIP FREE SHIPPING This is Department 56 #56623 New England Village " Mill Creek Crossing " . A new England setting is hardly complete without the romantic covered bridge. You can almost hear the echo of the clip-clopping horse hooves coming from inside. This impressive bridge features a wood frame and a slightly bowed roof, perhaps from the weight of the snow from many harsh New England winters. The wooden siding is painted a traditonal red and the floor of the bridges is made from local fieldstones. This nostalgic piece is a must for any New England village display and would make a wonderful and much appreciated gift for a collector. This early American covered bridge is MIB and has only been removed for inspection and photographing.

    <Description>An American Cultural Icon for Your Christmas Tree Here is a beautiful blown glass representation of the lovable, bumbling and cerebral character of the Wizard of Oz. The Scarecrow has a handsome face and a charm all his own, in this limited edition Christmas ornament, made in Poland by the famous Christopher Radko. He's part of a series of Wizard of Oz ornaments sold exclusively by the Warner Brothers Studio Store in the 1998 season. There was a scheduled run of 10,000 of these -- this one is numbered 1052. And since the Warner Brothers stores have been closing one-by-one coast-to-coast, this may be an item that was more rare than anticipated. This ornament has been lovingly stored in a climate controlled environment. No excessive heat, cold or humidity. This ornament has been displayed over the holidays at least once before. But this piece has always been put away better than it came from the store -- in acid-free archival tissue paper -- inside a ziploc bag to protect it from outside moisture -- and with extra padding. You'll find Radko's original tag enclosed as well. The box is in good condition. We've treated our Radko ornaments as treasured investments. We hope you will too. The Scarecrow originally sold for $45, when he was introduced in 1998. Please note that the opening bid is far below that, and the value of this lovely ornament should increase as years go by. So, if you would like something special from the Yellow Brick Road to bring a little bit of Oz to your Christmas tree, enter your opening bid now. Thanks for looking! Good luck! And Happy Holidays! Winning bidders will cover the cost of insured USPS Priority Mail. Item will be promptly shipped after a Billpoint or PayPal payment receipt; or upon receipt of a Money Order. Personal checks accepted, but item will be held for 10 business days after receipt of the check. Thanks again.</Description>

    <Description>Here is an Old Manning, Bowman &amp; Co. Silver Cocktail Shaker in great condition.

The spout stays in the lower position until you are done shaking and then is pulled up to reveal the strainer holes down inside. This is a real beauty and only has a small amount of wear just below the lip from use. It measures 4 3/4" wide by 8 1/2" tall and would make a great addition to the vintage home bar-ware collection or display_. Shipping for this item will be about $4.00..

    <Description>This is a pair of MONK Salt and Pepper shakers. Both are 4 1/4" high and 7 3/4" around at their thickest part. They are dated 1978 and are by ENESCO. A must have for a collector or a great set for a beginner too. As you can see by the picture they are an unusual pair. They have no chips, cracks nor any damaged areas anywhere. My picture does not do them justice. Buyer to pay $5.00 S/H. Insurance is extra and recommended as I am not responsible for items once I have shipped them. I sell/ship to Cont. USA only. I accept Paypal, cashier checks and money orders (No Personal Checks). I expect email communication within 3 days of auction end with your name and shipping address and your intended method of payment. I expect payment within 10 days of auction end or item will be re-listed and EBAY notified of non-payment. (Good excuses may be accepted on a case by case basis if communicated promptly.) Please email me with any questions before you bid as all my auctions/sales are final. Thank you and happy bidding.</Description>

    <Description>Hello? After a couple years in the great Silicon Valley I've decided that there is another thing that is lacking out here -- in addition to profits, start-up business plans and steady jobs -- there's no wall space [and @#!* little storage]. So, I've made the painful decision to keep a core and release back to the cosmos over half of the collection of Science Fiction, Fantasy and Comic original art I've gathered over the last 20 years. All these will be listed over the next two weeks with minimum bids less than half their pre-1990 appraised value -- and NO RESERVES . Please visit my other auctions for at least a .. visual pause... of more great SF&amp;F originals. I_ve loved them, you may too. Hello? is an original, signed painting by George Todd, done in 1985. It is approximately 8 inches by 5 inches, done in acrylic. I bought it from the artist at the NASFIC artshow in Phoenix, and the piece is in excellent condition [It has usually lived in sight near my desk]. While smaller, it is a superb piece....and reminds us that everyone fears the new, but still explores. Buyer owns the original painting only, all other reproduction rights reserved by artist.

    <Description>Hello. I'm new to this Mister Lister but I'll get the hang of it. Since it is a bulk upload these auctions will end within seconds of each other so please don't wait to bid. I know these listings will end almost too close to Christmas to be able to use as a gift but I'm sure the recipient will understand with the current state of the mail system. Having said that, this first offering is HUNDREDS of photo cover comics. They were pulled from a damp basement but each comic was bagged for protection. They smell a bit musty but are airing out nicely; I'll leave them unbagged until payment arrives which should give them a couple weeks from now to air out. Since they are not mine, I cannot offer any returns. What I can offer is nice old 10/12c comics for CHEAP (see my about me page by clicking on the ME page after my user id). They are all about VG; there are a few exceptions especially the cartoon/kid type books looke Fine to Very Fine in some cases. There's hints of oxidation at some staples but the scans should tell the story. I should have hi-res scans up within a day or two so prepare for the onslaught! I accept Paypal and paper payments; I don't do checkout or ebay online payments. E-mail me if you have any questions, please. I will give you very little description as I am trying to put hundreds of items up for as little as a dollar! The scans should tell the story; I will give you the Near Mint Book Value (NMBV) as a guide. Please bid early, bid with confidence, and read my about me page!

    <Description>(NOTICE: Payment accepted by BILLPOINT or PAY PAL ONLY. NO transactions by mail. No sale or shipment outside U.S.A.) POP BOTTLE MAGIC COMBO TWO AMAZING TRICKS (1) STARTLING POP BOTTLE PRODUCTION THERE IS NO FASTER BOTTLE PRODUCTION IN MAGIC! Imagine this effect: Away from all furniture or people, with your empty hands you pick up an empty sheet of newspaper, which you show all around, all sides of it. Then with no false moves, with your hands and the newspaper well away from your body, you crumple up the newspaper into a ball. Instantly, out of the balled-up newspaper pops a real bottle of pop or beer, which you can drink, give to spectator, or pour into a glass. The production is just that quick and just that clean! No suspicious moves. No steals from tables, chairs, or other persons. No sleeve load. No spills. No skill. The production is equally amazing on stage or in front of small audiences. I have used it in TV commercials and in shows of all kinds. Not an impromptu trick. You receive clear, complete, illustrated instructions and an astonishingly effective but very simple device. PLUS (2) SIR ISAAC NEWTON WOULD FLIP HIS LID IF HE SAW THE POP or BEER BOTTLE ANTIGRAVITY TRICK! THE PICTURE SHOWS THE TRICK IN ACTUAL OPERATION. YOU SEE SEVERAL TOOTHPICKS AND A PENCIL THAT HAVE BEEN INSERTED INTO THE MOUTH OF THE INVERTED BOTTLE OF WATER. THE TRICK NOW COMES WITH TWO OF THE GIMMICKS SO YOU WILL ALWAYS HAVE A SPARE! This is a famous and excellent impromptu pocket trick, endorsed by renowned magician and author, Dr. Harlan Tarbell, and many other famous magicians. Dr. Tarbell is said to have carried one of these "invisible" gimmicks for amazing "impromptu" performances. Dr. Tarbell wrote about how he used the effect in his shows, and wrote about its inventor, John Isely. John Scarne published a makeshift version of the trick in his magic book, although he did not reveal the real secret. This amazing trick depends on a very simple but ingenious little unseen gimmick that is always ready and extremely easy to use. You can carry this "little wonder" with you at all times. You will then be ready to baffle onlookers any place that you can simply borrow a pop bottle or beer bottle of water. Spectators watch closely as you take an unprepared bottle of water and turn it totally upside down, yet the water obeys your magical command and DEFIES GRAVITY--THE WATER DOES NOT RUN OUT OF THE BOTTLE! To prove it's real, you insert matches, toothpicks, and pencils into mouth of inverted bottle--they float up to the top of the water--yet THE WATER STILL DOES NOT RUN OUT OF THE BOTTLE. The water remains suspended in the inverted bottle until you will it to pour out! Spectators may examine the bottle with a microscope! REMEMBER, SPECTATOR MAY FILL THE BOTTLE, EXAMINE IT BEFORE AND AFTER YOUR TRICK, AND EMPTY IT. Some of my customers produce a pop bottle of water using our Startling Pop Bottle Production, hand the bottle out for examination, then take the bottle back and immediately perform this antigravity trick. Perform this anywhere, anytime. No skill required. "Impromptu" tricks as outstanding and effective as this one are few, but even one such trick performed properly can greatly enhance a magician's reputation. You receive original, copyright, clear, step-by-step instructions and presentation tips that make the performing very easy. REMEMBER, I NOW PROVIDE YOU WITH TWO OF THE "ANTIGRAVITY" GIMMICKS SO YOU WILL HAVE A SPARE IF YOU SHOULD LOSE ONE. THE POP BOTTLE MAGIC COMBO - BOTH THE ABOVE TRICKS - $10.97 PLUS $1.26 SHIPPING.

They have 3 decorative hearts on them that look as if they are made out of flowers (not sure how well they turn out in the picture) They are a great looking piece that would add a touch of elegance to your home. The rubber around the bottom of the one looks as if it got too hot at one point and on the other one of the little piece of rubber is tore halfway off, but it isn't shown since that is where they go into a holder. The one also has a couple of small scratches on it but not noticeable. I represent a client a on this item and they have gave statement that the informaion is" To the best of their knowledge true and without compromise."

    <Description>Welcome to the Holiday Season. Being offered for your consideration, with NO RESERVE , is this wonderful Vintage Hard Maple Rolling Pin. Dating back to the 17th century, rolling pins were originally hand carved from various hard woods. Mass production began during the late 1800's, and by 1902 the Sears Roebuck Company introduced the first revolving handled rolling pin. This particular rolling pin has revolving handles, and is made of hard maple wood. The grain of the maple wood is beautiful. Measuring 18" in total length, this piece is in wonderful condition. The wood has been well preserved with no scratches or defects, and both revolving handles turn freely and smoothly. ~ PLEASE NOTE ~ that I have two additional rolling pins currently on Ebay.

The designs of this region are varied and are not used as a guide to the origin of the rug. Distinctive designs are associated with particular towns and villages such as Bibikabad, Ingelas, Dergezin, and Husianabad, all are generally referred to as Hamadans. Key characteristics are similarities in weave and colors. Almost all Hamadans are single wefted, a row of weft runs between each row of knots, using the Turkish/Symmetrical knot, with 40-100 knots per square inch. Most of the rugs of this region use similar strong, dark colors, including reds, blues, ivory and brown. Often they are woven mixing goat or camel hair mixed with wool or cotton. Designs are bold and geometric, incorporating many hexagonal and diamond-shaped designs including sharply angled medallions and zigzag patterns, which represent lightening. Stylized florals and utilization of the herati pattern are also quite common. Many older pieces, mostly runners, were woven on wool foundations with undyed camel hair and are therefore camel colored. Modern rugs have cotton foundations with stronger, darker colors, often with bright accent colors. It is now very rare to find them in the classic camel color. Hamadans are considered some of the best values in Persian rugs. _ Click HERE for answers to Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ).

It is the fifth Star Trek Ornament in the series. It is mint in mint box and has never been removed from the box. The picture was taken from my personal displayed ornament. This ornament is unique because it the heaviest of all the ornaments. It was made with a special material which, when it is not lit, reflects a green irredescent look. I personally think it is the most beautiful of all the ornaments. As you can see from my second picture it also lights up - green running lights.

    <Description>THE INCREDIBLE HULK: FUTURE IMPERFECT 2 Issue Mini-Series by Peter David and George Perez It's the Future_Ruled by the Hulk! After a holocaust which has wiped out most of the Earth's population and the Earth's Greatest Heroes, all that remains is a battered imitation of the human spirit and an aged, world-weary Hulk--who now styles himself the dictator of remains as the Maestro. Enter the Hulk. The good Doctor Banner we all know and love. He's in the future fighting against himself for the sake of humanity. In the past the Hulk has battled his share of power-mad tyrants before: Draxon the Dictator, the Gremlin, Farnoq Dahn of Trans-Sabal, and the Leader. But now he must face himself--the most hateful and powerful dictator of the worst of all possible realities. The Hulk is trapped in a world he made. Peter David has said that he is most proud of this work. This 2 issue mini-series is a fine example comics collaboration, and characteristic of David's ability to bring out the best in artists. Proceeds go to help fund my film, so bids are welcome and appreciated. Thanks for helping make my dream a reality. METHOD OF PAYMENT Postal Money Order or Cashier's Check only, please. SHIPPING $3.90. Everything is shipped Priority Mail, Delivery Confirmation (for my protection as well as yours. This way I can track the shipment should the postal service _misplace_ it. There have been a few people that chose to waive the priority shipping and when their package was lost or delayed, they came back to me demanding that I locate their item, so this shipping method is non-negotiable. Sorry). I ONLY ship within the U.S. No exceptions (and no exceptions mean just that, so be prepared for a big, resounding _NO_ when you e-mail me to make an exception for you. And don_t take it personally. It_s not you. I_ve just been burned 3 times on foreign transactions_and I_m not willing to try it again). If payment is not received within 14 days of end of auction, I will re-list the item and leave negative feedback. Again, I apologize, but I_m trying to raise money in a hurry. If you_re not serious about buying the item, please don_t bid on it. Thanks and HAPPY BIDDING! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>Wagner's Original 1891 Skillet Description and Item Information Up for auction is this large Wagner's cast iron skillet. This is the 10 inch skillet, with two pouring spouts. It would be a good frying pan to use, or it would look good hanging in your kitchen! Identification The pan is marked on the base "Wagner's 1891 Original Cast Iron Cookware 10 Inch Skillet Made in USA." The pan also has seasoning instructions on the underside. Condition The pan is in good used condition! It has some cooking residue and light surface rust, but it will probably clean up just fine. I have not attempted to clean this pan. There is a small notch in the pan's rim, but I think the pan was molded that way; I don't think it is a chip in the iron. Customer Service Pledge Please note: I NEVER charge a handling fee on my eBay transactions! It seems more and more that sellers like me are in the minority. I use only quality packing materials like peanuts and bubble wrap (where applicable), the cost of which I absorb as a conscientious seller. Don't be afraid to bid on my items because you think there might be hidden costs, undisclosed information, slow response, or shoddy packing!

I do not charge for handling, but only for shipping and insurance. I use USPS Priority Mail for all parcels that weigh one pound or more (unless otherwise requested, or in special circumstances like for very large or heavy items). If you have other shipping preferences, please let me know. Insurance is optional, but highly recommended. Insurance costs will be included for instant payment items.

    <Description>you are look at a autographed art which is signed by Grace Lee Whitney, George Takei, and Colm Meaney. this art is from a convention in Arlington, Texas, called Tex-Trek 93. All of the autographs are in gold ink. The picture is also signed by the artist, Jamie, which I think makes this piece truly nice. I was told that these three were the crew of the USS Excelsior. Takei was the captain, Whitney, was the communications officer, and Meaney (O'Brian) was the chief engineer. This is a remarkable and beautiful autographed picture. It is in a heavy duty black metal frame that measures 26" wide and 22" tall. also this picture is in mint condition,this is a must have for your collection,I except paypal and money orders,15.00 for shipping and handling, 7 to 10 days for delivery,and 3.00 for insurance thanks for looking,check out my other auctions.have a nice holiday</Description>

    <Description>Wow...look at the work involved here. This pretty antique bedspread is all hand embroidered and stitched together in light weight cotton panels. Each panel is different with a white lace edging all around. It was made by an older European woman and I bought it at her estate sale. It would fit a twin size bed and measures 58"x85". It could also even make a great table cloth.It is still in great condition....</Description>

    <Description>LOT #29 CAPTAIN AMERICA #332-#381 COMPLETE.50 consecutive issues.High grade copies.Shipping and handling to the U.S.A. is approximately $7.00 surface mail. Shipping and handling from Canada to the U.S.A. is a standard rate for packages weighing less than 1 kilogram (approximately 2 pounds). Regarding packages weighing equal to or more than 1 kilogram ,the further the distance,the more expensive the rate will be.That is why I can only provide an approximation at this time. Please e-mail me for an exact quote,and estimated time of arrival to your state. If you reside in Canada,I'll need to know you're postal code to determine shipping fees. If you reside overseas,I'll need to know in which country.I accept checks,and postal/international U.S.money orders .Automatic negative feedback if payment is not received within 3 weeks of my first e-mail. I will most likely re-list the item at that point.I suggest that winners send payment by air mail to speed things up. ***QUEBEC RESIDENTS ADD GST AND QST ***. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>This is an ivory/off white colored popcorn chenille bedspread. Sorry the color is not right in the pictures. All cotton. It is in very good condition. It measures 100"Lx82"W. I found two very, very small pink spots near the bottom end of the spread. They do not show when it hangs down. Also on one corner the fringe needs tacked back up, about 2". This spread is not thin nor could I find any missing chenille. Nice long fringe. Selling as is. Shipping will be $6.50. Offering 14 other chenille bedspreads this week. Thank you for looking and good luck!</Description>

It is 13 1/2" tall to the top of the lid, not counting the handles!! That's alotta ice! It's diameter is about 8". It is in good to very good used condition. There are 2 small shallow dent on one side about the size of a smaller thumb impression, but if you turn it around, it won't bother a soul! It has a brushed finish and a polished finish for the top and lid. It could use a nice polishing and I think you'd be happy with it. It has had a piece of masking tape on the side and the glue has dried when pulled off, so that will take a little cleaning. I'm sure you don't want me to break a finger nail! (haha) Let me send you this unusually large ice bucket so you'll be ready for holiday festivities!! Made in Italy! Even comes with tongs!

    <Description>This auction is for a 1999 MINT Hallmark Star Trek Rio Grande Ornament. The ornament was never opened until today for a level 10 diagnostic, and it_s box is in excellent condition with some slight shelfwear. This would make a great gift for the Trek fan in your life. The Rio Grande flew off the shelves two years ago at warp speed and, like all Trek ships has been retired from production. It was the second ship since the _92 Galileo that featured a character_s voice from Star Trek_and it has WORF_S VOICE!! (He says _I wish you a most honorable holiday. Qapla!_) The Rio Grande was one of three runabouts assigned to DS9 and would look GREAT with this years new ornament which IS the Deep Space Nine space station!

    <Description>2.5 yards of Hydrangeas NO RESERVE! You are bidding on 2.5 yards of a wonderful fabric suitable for upholstery or drapery. The piece is 54" wide and slightly brighter than it appears in the picture. Please look at our other bhcraver auctions on ebay for even more terrific fabrics! We accept paypal. Winner to pay shipping. Non smoking environment. We ship via UPS or the Postal Service and are not responsible for uninsured items shipped via the Postal Service that are lost or damaged. We recommend to those of you that have your packages shipped via the Postal Service that you purchase Postal Delivery Confirmation (.40-$1.50) but we will not include this charge unless asked. This is the only method the Postal Service has of tracking your package. If you do not purchase this all we can tell you is the date your package was shipped. Items shipped using UPS are automatically insured. ALL international orders, as well as all shipments to PO Boxes in the U.S., are sent ONLY by the United States Postal Service. If you plan on purchasing more than one item and wish to consolidate shipping do not use the "checkout" option which appears after an auction closes. Please note that the selvage may have one small hole every yard. The selvage is usually a narrow strip of fabric that runs along both sides of the material and is not used for upholstering. These small holes will in no way effect the use of the fabric. The holes are a result of the way that we sometimes measure short pieces. Please ask any questions you might have about the item BEFORE you bid. If you have any reservations please do not bid as all sales are final. At auctions end we will send the winning bidder an email asking for their address so that we can calculate shipping charges. Due to space limitations we will only consolidate up to ten days worth of winning bids. The ten days begin after the first piece that you win closes. Unfortunately there are NO EXCEPTIONS to this rule as we are operating out of a small space and simply do not have the room to consolidate indefinitely. If you do wish to consolidate it is your responsibility to keep track of what you have won. If payment is not received within 2 weeks from end of auction we reserve the right to relist item and leave negative feedback. DO NOT BID IF YOU DON'T PLAN ON PAYING IN A TIMELY MANNER!

    <Description>This auction is for a very old Souvenir Pennant from New York City. It looks to me to be from the 1930's -1950's. It is made of Navy blue wool felt with white lettering and a nice multi colored graphic of The Empire State Bldg. The Statue of Liberty and The R C A Building. It has one tiny thumbtack hole in the small end. Very nice display condition.It measures about 23 and 1/2 inches long and it will come to you safely packaged priority mail..Thanks for looking ! If no image appears try refresh/reload..Pay with paypal for guaranteed delivery by Christmas! I ship all fragile items with insurance and confirmation. Never a handling fee, actual postage only.I ship USPS priority mail. The post office is kind enough to supply packing materials.If I shipped regular mail I would have to buy boxes etc. and pass the cost on to you, so priority mail is the best deal. Please Email me with any questions.</Description>
