    <Description>BRAND NEW!!! This is a beautiful super-soft stretch cotton blouse by the Italian label DIVINA. Silky smooth stretch poplin with slight gathering at the shoulders and extra-wide, split french cuffs. Size is a USA 6, and will fit up to a 34" bust, 28" waist. I have a corset that might go well with this if you want to modify Carrie's chic corset/blouse combo from the 3rd season premiere of Sex and the City. This is really a beautiful, high-quality blouse that will work equally well for work or evening. Take a look at my other auctions - I have tons of cute stuff (especially tops!) and all items are either brand new or nearly new. I have a real Sex and the City aesthetic when it comes to my shopping habits - I 'll buy anything from anywhere so long as it's a little bit different and looks cool, so please browse my listings; I'm sure you'll be able to find something to your liking! :) GOOD LUCK BIDDING!!! I'll ship via Priority and accept money orders or PayPal. ***Payment must be received within 10 days of auction's end - eBay will otherwise be notified of non-paying bidders. Sorry to crack the whip but far too many capricious, careless bidders have cost me time and money...***</Description>

    <Description>A spectacular basic that every fuller figured woman loves!! Super looking body sculpting shaper slip from Crown in a short length. Perfect to wear under the shortest of dresses making the body appear slimmer and smoother. Soft cups are strategically made for extra support and comfort. No underwire. Bottom edge has a no-slip band so this slip will not ride up your hips under your dress!! Adjustable "Bra-Type" straps. Front and Back is paneled for extra control and shaping These shapers fit very snuggly. If you prefer a looser fit, please bid accordingly. I am offering these at well below the retail price of $50.00 to $60.00 because they are slightly soiled. The soiling is from packaging...not from being worn.

    <Description>Brand New Dr. Martens Navy Blue Tennis Shoes UK Size 7 Mens US Size 8 Womens US Size 9 - 9.5 New in the Box The only thing that I can think of that would be more comfy than Dr. Marens Boots or Sandals is Dr. Martens tennis shoes. These are the most comforatble shoes around! All of my shoes are brand new and authentic - just like from a department store. The box reads Navy Tracker 5 Eyelet Sporty Tie Z Welt Buzz Sole. These look incredible with jeans and the yellow sticthing and navy blue colors complement each other very well. This is just an all around good looking shoe! HERE'S THE SCOOP ON THE SIZE: For those of you familiar with Dr. Martens sizing, these run the same as most other Docs . For those of you who are new to the Doc Martin crowd, the inside of the shoe is 10 1/4 inches long and the sole is 11 3/4 inches long. I wear a US Womens 9.5 and the UK 7 US Mens 8 US Womens 9 in this style fits me great, so these run slightly large compared to US sizes. Check the measurement to be sure before placing your bid because everyone's foot is unique and I DO NOT ACCEPT RETURNS (costly to you and time consuming for me). If you are not sure about your size, just email me and I can help you decide what size you will need. There are a few things we can do to insure that you order the correct size. IF YOU HAVE NEVER HAD DOCS BEFORE: I strongly suggest that you head to the mall and try some on - then come back to me and save a bundle. Be SURE that if you are buying boots, try on a pair of boots, if you are buying sandals try on a pair of sandals, etc. Most docs run the same, but some of my customers have found a discrepancy in the sizing from different types of shoes. Again, everyone's foot is different. I haven't found this to be the case with my size, but it is ALWAYS better to be safe than sorry. Be sure to check out my other Dr. Martins auctions - I have many unique styles - some of which can't be found anywhere else on ebay. Click Here to Check Out My Other Auctions For More Unique Docs! Terms of sale: Shipping is $ 8.00 via UPS including a tracking number and insurance . Alaska, Hawaii, APO, and P.O. Box addresses ship via United States Priority Mail for $10.00. Shoes to be shipped via Priority Mail are sent out on Thursdays only. I strongly recommend UPS. Canadian addresses ship via the United States Postal Service and shipping options will be decided at the end of the auction. I accept Personal checks / Money Orders / Cashier's checks / and Paypal. All Personal checks will be held for 10 days and all payments must be received within 10 days of auction's end.</Description>

    <Description>Brand New Dr. Martens Black, Red and Navy Blue Tri Color Mary Jane Sandals UK Size 6 Mens US Size 7 Womens US Size 8 - 8.5 New in the Box These Dr. Marten Mary Janes are classy and sassy! All of my shoes are brand new and authentic - just like from a department store. The box reads Black + Burgundy + Navy Burnish Multi Panel Mary Jane Sandal. This style has a silver buckle with Dr. Martens written in Black and an embossed DM logo on the outside of each shoe. There is a red and navy criss cross pattern on the toe - cute, cute, cute! This is another very flattering shoe. HERE'S THE SCOOP ON THE SIZE: For those of you familiar with Dr. Martens sizing, these run the same as most other Docs . For those of you who are new to the Doc Martin crowd, the inside of the shoes is 9 3/4 inches long and the sole is 11 inches long. I wear a womens US 9.5 and the UK 7 US 9 in this style fits me perfectly. Check the measurement to be sure before placing your bid because everyone's foot is unique and I DO NOT ACCEPT RETURNS (too costly to you and too time consuming for me). If you are not sure about your size, just email me and I can help you decide what size you will need. There are a few things we can do to insure that you order the correct size.

    <Description>FLARED JEANS, Little Girls, Size 4 These are little girls Size 4 Buffalo Jeans, with 5 pockets, Elastic Back, Snap &amp; Zipper Closure. They have two dragonflies embroidered on the right thigh. Nice pair of jeans in good condition. This picture does NOT do these jeans justice. They are the faded type of jeans with no wear or tear. I bought these jeans for my daughter from another eBayer, but they are a little snug in her waist. I believe the eBayer I bought these jeans from said that these jeans were only worn once since her granddaugher had another pair of the same jeans. There is a very faint and very small red mark about 1" above the highest dragonfly that wasn't mentioned in the auction that I bought these jeans from. My daughter just loved these jeans when I bought them, but like I already mentioned, they were snug so she only tried them on and took them off. Buyer is responsible for Shipping and Handling at $3.50 Priority Mail and if requested, insurance, at $1.10 (optional). I accept payments by money order, cashiers check, personal check (held for 10 days), credit card OR electronic check by PayPal OR eBay Payments (Billpoint). Feel free to e-mail me with any questions.

    <Description>The great Blue Fish finds just keep coming! I have a large load of Blue Fish that I will be listing over the next week or so, so check back often. This is an incredible Blue Fish Jacket from an unknown year. A nice heavy weight organic cotton. It is in excellent condition. Great paint on this one. I think the pictures speak for themselves. The designs are all over the front and back. Has a great printed button as the single button. The color is a lovely Cherry Red. Has nice long sleeves, and the back hangs down about 6 inches lower then the front. It also has two great hidden pockets. I have tried, but I can not find this one in any of the catalogs. This is a wonderful and Blue Fish jacket and I am happy to offer it to you. I included a picture of the artist's signature block. Tag inside reads ONE SIZE FITS ALL. It measures 37 inches across under the arms or 74 inches around. The waist measurement is the same. It is 39 inches from the top of the shoulder to the bottommost part.(This is the measurement of the back where it hangs lower, straight down from one shoulder.) From shoulder to bottom, measuring the front, it measures 30 inches. Great vintage Blue Fish in excellent condition. High bidder pays shipping &amp; handling(Insurance is extra if desired.) and contacts me after the close of the auction. All items shipped through US Postal Service. I will ship internationally, but please realise that foreign sales ussually cost MUCH more to ship. Therefore any foreign bidders must notify me of their exact address at auctions end, so that I may calculate shipping charges. Also, due to a service charge by my bank for Canadian Money Orders, I am afraid I must ask that you send cash. Payment to be made within 7 days of our e-mail contact or item is re-listed. Pennsylvania Residents please add 6% sales tax. Happy bidding and please check out my other auctions. :) We want happy customers. If you have any questions, feel free to e-mail us.

    <Description>Ever wanted a dress that'll shock your friends because it's so vintage or perfect? Well, this teal/green dress is absolutely vintage and retro. It would look great under any slip or psychedelic under dress, mix and match and make your friends say WOW, that looks great on you!! This vintage dress has little flowers scattered all over and the neck, end of sleeves and bottom of dress looks lacey. I think the size is small or medium. The width circumference measures 35 inches from underarm to underarm. The length measures 43 inches, top of shoulder to bottom of dress. The arm length measures 22 inches from shoulder seam to wrist seam. The circumference of the arm is 14 inches. This dress can be stretched a little too. Please note that the color is not blue but a bright green/teal. If you have further questions please email me. The shipping and handling will be $3.95 for priortiy mail. I will ship international, however I will need to check mailing prices. TERMS Paypal will email you within 24 hours of auction close to let you know your final total. Payment is to be received within 10 days of auction close unless other arrangements have been made. If payment has not been received, and no contact has been made, the item will be re-listed and the appropriate feedback will be left. Insurance is $1.10 for anything valued up to $50.00. Insurance is recommended as I am not responsible for packages lost by the USPS. All items are freshly laundered and they will be in excellent to gently used condition unless otherwise noted in the description. I accept the following forms of payment: Paypal is my favorite but I also accept Money Order and Cashiers Check. After the transaction is clear and in good standing, I will leave positive feedback and hope you will do the same for me. If you feel I have misrepresented something, I will gladly refund your money for the item only, and ask that you ship it back to me before I refund your money. Please check back to my site often, I am always listing new clothing and novelties. Have A Happy Day :)</Description>

    <Description>On auction is a black leather biker-style jacket. Lots of buckles and zippers. This jacket is actually not cow hide leather but is lambskin, making it super, super soft. It is fully lined and also is "padded" for extra warmth. I bought this years ago for over $300.00, but have since moved away from my LA home and is now not my style. It's a men's XL but fits a woman much better. Comes to about high hip length and still looks great. This jacket is used, no rips or tears, but is well broken in. I accept paypal and money orders. Buyer to pay priority mail shipping (this will be a heavy item). Email me any questions. Thanks for looking and good luck bidding.</Description>

    <Description>Wenger and Victorinox can both use the SWISS army shield, because both can legally claim to make the Original Swiss Army watch/knife ~~depending on where you stand when you say it, but this like new, and never used WENGER Battalion #90210 is a fine example of WENGER SWISS FINEST model military watch. Very prized and desired among both men and women, it would make an ideal gift. From my private collection, it will go fast. This is a large man's size watch at a whopping 42cm diameter, slightly over 1 1/2 inches diameter. White dial, luminous numbers (except at 12, 9, and 3) and white number calendar date, only, window at 3, and the WENGER Swiss Army shield at 12, all done in stylish WENGER style. Striking, and masculine, water resistant, with a fully functioing elapsed time bezel. The band is joined hatch marked double chevron joined link ss bracelet with a double deployment clasp with Wenger's SWISS Army logo. No box, no papers, but this is the real banana. Gift box is available on this one at a slight additional cost. But, what sets this watch apart is that unlike discounter chains online, the serial number on the back case is intact. This watch will go early. Get the fondue and rosti cooked and ready and stoke the fire, it is ski weather in Helvicia. Frohlich Weinachten, guten nacht und Happy bidding.</Description>

    <Description>Know More. Sell More. ChannelAdvisor. _ Outerwear Factory Kids Jacket Sz 10 This is a great coat for playing outside this winter. I noticed that there is a small area on the patch that wasn't sewn at the factory. Not noticable at all. I did wash this jacket but not all of the spots came out. It looks like maybe the black faded a little, very minor, but I like to mention anything I see. Thats why I say a great outside coat. For the price if they mess it up, it didn't cost you a fortune. It is a very thick coat and will be very warm. Has a small hood in a zipper pocket on the collar. Has a zipper down the front with velcro also.

If you have questions, please ask them before you bid and win the auction. Thanks for looking! I am very fair about allowing ample time for payment to arrive, but will send out a second notice for payment after 10 days and a Non-Paying Bidder Alerts will be filed with Ebay if payment doesn t arrive shortly after. In the event of a return, all shipping costs to and from the seller will be paid by the bidder. Canadian/International Bidders: I will be marking the customs slip as merchandise and not a gift . If you have a problem with this, then please don t bid. I will not lie on the customs slip.

Thank you to all the wonderful people on the net! I want to say sorry to other wonderful people that try to help me and i did not email back, Thank you too! ****First of all this message is for the ebay and yahoo sellers!!!**** ***Dear EBay/Yahoo Sellers~ Please stop copying my pictures or copying word for word from my auctions to post on your auctions. Please provide your own pictures and auction description, because I would not like bidders to confuse all of us as of one seller. And please make this easier for all of us. I'm the original owner of these pictures! Thank you! Warning! Dear Bidders please be careful when bidding for name brand stuff especially Popular name items. The best way to find out is to take it to the Boutique or places that sells them. If you have any question on this please feel free to email me, I will be very glad to help you!!! OK! First of all, i want to make sure that you understand this is for an 100% Authentic Newest 2001 collection and one of the Hottest TIFFANY item -- ****TIFFANY 925 Pure Stealing Silver Venetian Link Bracelet!!!*** This auction will include the gift box w/ lid and white ribbon, the care card, and the famous powder blue dust pouch!!!! Measures 7.5" inches long, perfect for everyone!!! If this is too long for you then you can bring it back to Tiffany and have them adjust/cut it to your wrist size. Feel lucky if you have one!!! It is Brand New, and never been used!!!!! Give it out as a gift or keep it!!! This is a great piece for your love one!!! All Time Sold out! Popular piece!!!! Suprise Chanel sample will also be included in this auction!!! I notice that there are many fakes out there and i do not want to be mistaken as one of them. If i listed 'authentic', it means that i purchased personally at an authentic retailer. And if you see 'authenticity not guaranteed' that means it is 100% FAKE or a good copy! So why pay so much for a fake item, when just a little more you can get an authentic item??? Besides, if later on when you decide you don't want it anymore, the Authentic designer item would still has it's value vs. no one would care for fake bags!!! Please Think!!!! It is not worth it to get fakes! This is a perfect to go with my other TIFFANY or other Sterling Silver by Gu*ci auctions(please check out my other auctions). It is the perfect set to go out with!!! I don't think i need to tell you more about this, look at the pictures and see for yourself. Feel free to email me if you have any questions, please don't email me and ask if it is authentic, because it is 100% guaranteed Authentic!!!!! Winner please add $7 for Shipping &amp; Insurance.

We suggest the following guidelines: 1._Select a seller with a good reputation (see feedback) 2._Be specific about the date you need the item when you send payment. 3._If using a credit card select a seller with a secure server. 4._Ask questions before you bid. 5._Inquire about refund policy. 6._Check seller's shipping rates. 7._Bid early. We have been selling for over five years on eBay. Together we have more than 3000 positive feedback points. We guarantee our merchandise to be as advertised and welcome queries regarding it. We pack and ship carefully without inflated shipping charges. Enjoy shopping on line confidently. ___ Meredith &amp; Dana S. Whaley ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ AUCTION CLOSING FAQ: 1. We ship in the order in which we receive payment unless there is an emergency request. 2. We ship twice a week. As a result, Buy It Now does not automatically mean Ship It Now. 3. Money Orders are treated the same as checks and do not speed delivery. We prefer checks because should they be lost in the mail they are far easier for the buyer to trace. 4. We do not, as so many others do, charge $4 &amp; $5 on shipping small items such as jewelry and we do not send jewelry Priority unless requested in an attempt to save our buyers money. 5. We recommend insurance for all items and will not be held for damage or non-delivery of uninsured items. 6. Postal Claims: Insured items do have a guarantee against damage or non-delivery. For damaged items it is necessary for the buyer to present the packaging and the item to the Post Office to begin the claim. For non-delivered items we will file a trace/claim with the Post Office and the Post Office will then reimburse the buyer for qualifying claims. 7. Please read our e-mail and follow our instructions for the fastest possible shipping. 8. Please include your item #, e-mail address and shipping address so we can serve you promptly and give you positive feedback on receipt of payment. No item is sent out broken unless advertised as damaged. We recommend insurance to protect the buyer. We make every effort to advertise items fairly and do not refund for buyer s remorse. If there is some question about an item arrangements for possible refund need to be made in advance of shipment. We are sorry, but we can no longer issue refunds for clothing.

    <Description>I bought this off of Ebay a few months ago but never wore it. I do not know the origin of this top except it looks like someone might have made it themselves. It's well made actually. The material is shimmery and ever so slightly furry. It's just a little too long and big for me. There is black lace around the top. It seems to be in good condition from what I can tell. It's probably a Large or Extra Large by my guess. Would look really cute with some dark cuffed jeans. Shipping will be $3.50 with priority mail (2-3 day delivery). I accept money orders from all, and personal checks from users with 30+ positive feedback. You are resonsible for any bank fees due to a bounced personal check, so please do not write any bad checks :( You'll have to pay any and all bank fees. I have to wait 7 days for the check to clear before mailing the item. I ship to the United States only. I think that covers it all, any questions, please ask me :) Thanks much for looking at my auction, and check out my other auctions for more cool clothes as I am in the process of cleaning out my closet!

    <Description>This is The Hat. The Pakol is an excellent quality wool hat. Great for rock climbing, snowboarding and other winter sports or just looking cool/warm? Get one while you can. The Pakol has become increasingly hard to find since the assassination of Afghanistan Northern Alliance leader Ahmed Massoud by the Taliban on 9/9/01. --That's right, 2 days prior to the US attacks-- Massoud wore the Pakol and members of the Northern Alliance have adopted it as The Hat to wear when hunting Taliban. You can find out about Massoud here: http://www.afgha.com/glossaire-comm.php?op=LirComm&amp;sid=52 I have located three different suppliers of these hats and ordered 1 dozen hats from each to ensure delivery ASAP. I am auctioning the first shipment to arrive. Shipment is expected in 3 weeks, but not guaranteed. I will ship -as soon as possible-. Shipping cost is $3.00, continental USA only. Retail price is $30.00 on these hats. I will donate any amount bid over $25.00 to help Afghan children. I prefer PayPal. I will accept Money Orders and Cashiers Checks if sent promptly.

    <Description>LONG SLEEVE LADIES EMBROIDERED SHIRT By THAT'S THE WAY TO GO SIZE MEDIUM This is a gently worn shirt that you will just love if you like a little novelty. It has a brown corduroy collar and different colored buttons down the front. Each side on the front has a different embroidery. On the left side is a large embroidery of Noah's Ark on the water. Noah is standing on the deck with 2 birds overhead and 2 penguins walking on board. The front of the ark is decorated with the heads of two elephants and two seals. I took a close-up of the sleeve so you could have a better idea of the color and fabric of this shirt. Looks much better than my pictures. The other side is embroidered with two zebras and two giraffes. Above the animals is embroidered "Two By Two" in a half circle with a yellow flower underneath. The shirt is a light brown almost, but not quite, pinstripe. It does have shoulder pads. The sleeves measure 22" from shoulder seam and 29" from collar. About 22" across front from underarm. Cute Noah's Ark theme. Winning bidder is responsible for the cost of shipping and insurance. I prefer Billpoint, BidPay or Paypal but also accept money orders and cashier's checks from USA bidders. Online payments, only, from International bidders. I usually ship and leave feedback the same day as payment is received. This transaction is not complete until you leave feedback.
