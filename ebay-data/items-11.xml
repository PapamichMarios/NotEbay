PLEASE READ THIS PAGE COMPLETELY BEFORE ORDERING I understand that certain cable television equipment sold legally may nevertheless be used in an unauthorized manner to aid in the illegal acquisition of cable television services. The law prohibits the reception of premium channels, including Pay-Per-View without the proper payment for all services received. Since your cable company may have no way of telling that you are using your own cable equipment, it is your responsibility to notify them of that. The purchaser must comply with all local, state and federal laws regarding the ownership of cable TV equipment. You are required by law to pay for all the services that you receive. We sell these converters to customers who subscribe to FULL Premium Service Cable, and would like to own their own equipment, instead of renting the cable equipment. It may also be used for customers who pay for full service cable and would like to add an additional TV set, just like a telephone or cellular extension. This may save you the fee of renting an additional converter from you service provider. Since the cable companies may have no way of knowing that you are using your own equipment, YOU MUST Notify your cable company that you are using your own equipment, and comply with all local, state, and federal laws regarding the private ownership of cable products. Theft of cable service is illegal. You must pay for all the channels that you can receive! We do not advocate unauthorized use or theft of cable services!

There are various brown discoloration spots around the rim and on the bottom where it sits on the surface area.There are no chips, scratches, or cracks. It measures appx. 8 1/2" across and depicts a girl milking a cow. All the colors are in the yellow, green and rust of Brock of California. It is marked with Brock of California. It will make a great addition to your collection. Buyer pays shipping and insurance &amp; I accept Paypal, money order, or check (7 day hold) Thanks for looking and have a great holiday.

    <Description>1979 SUSAN B. ANTHONY PDS FDC SET THE ISSUANCE OF THE UNITED STATES SUSAN B. ANTHONY DOLLAR IS OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO COLLECTORS BECAUSE OF TWO NOTABLE ASPECTS: IT IS THE FIRST RESIZING OF THE DOLLAR COIN IN MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AND IT MARKS THE FIRST U.S. COIN EVER TO HONOR A WOMAN. DESIGNED BY FRANK GASPARRO, CHIEF ENGRAVER AND SCULPTOR OF THE U.S. BUREAU OF THE MINT, THE COIN IS SIZED BETWEEN THE CURRENT QUARTER AND HALF DOLLAR. ITS UNIQUE ELEVEN-SIDED BORDER MAKES THE DOLLAR EASILY DISTINGUISHABLE TO THE TOUCH. THESE COINS WERE STRUCK AT ALL THREE U.S. MINTS AND FIRST RELEASED TO THE NATION ON JULY 2, 1979. THE STEEL ENGRAVED CACHET ON EACH SUSAN B. ANTHONY COVER DEPICTS THAT COIN'S PLACE OF MINTING. SET COMES HOUSED IN A BLACK BOX WITH A CERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY DEPICTING THE FIRST DAY OF ISSUE SPECIMENS. NO RESERVE Buyer to pay $3.00 for shipping and handling.

Trouble brews when Gruntilda the witch captures the unbearably beatiful cub, Tooty.

Combining their 24 moves and special powers, Banjo and Kazooie will fend off armies of beasts. Bear and bird must hunt down the 100 puzzle pieces and 900 musical notes that will ultimately lead them to Gruntilda. However, miles of swamp, desert, and snow and one bear of an adventure stand in their way. Soar over islands to scout out buried treasure. Brave past whirling blades in the belly of a mechanical shark. With some voodoo magic, transform into different creatures to gain special powers. Solve the puzzles of the ancients to unearth the cursed labyrinths. This game is so much fun and colorful. It's a great price. Combine with my other games on auction and save on shipping! No Reserve!

    <Description>There are 4 of these American Encaustic Tiles, they all measure 6" by 6". They all have a nice thick shiney glaze and all have crazing. There are two that are perfect with no chips, one has a chip in the lower corner that is shown in the photo, the same tile has a tiny chip on the side and a glaze bubble that popped. The last tile has two teenie tiny chips on the edges. All of these need to be cleaned up, there is grout still left on some of the sides and bottom of the tiles. They have a nice look to them and would be great in a table or framed. The photos are not blurry, that is the way the tiles look. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>READ THIS INFORMATION BEFORE BIDDING HP LaserJet II Printer This auction is for a Hewlett Packard LaserJet II Laser Printer. This printer powers up, runs through its diagnostics, and says that it is ready to print, but I haven't been able to test printing with it because I don't have the drivers for it. The printer is in good condition cosmetically and includes a removable paper tray. There is some sticky residue left from when labels were removed from the casing, and there are a few labels still left on it, but the casing has no cracks or signs of damage. I have another one of these printers in identical condition, so if the winning bidder wants to buy two of them, I'll list the second one in a Buy It Now auction for the same amount as the winning bid. Good luck, and thanks for looking! READ THIS INFORMATION BEFORE BIDDING Terms and Conditions: I will email the winning bidder shortly after close-of-auction (typically less than 24 hours.) The winning bidder should reply with their full address and phone number (you don't have to give me this, but if you don't I'll put my number on your shipping label.) I ship FedEx Ground for most items and can provide you with a shipping quote if you email me your zip code. Please request your quote before the day your auction ends. I charge exact shipping charges and exact packaging charges-- I will also quote these to you. If we receive payment by Saturday at noon, your package will go out to FedEx on the weekend and ship out on Monday morning. If we receive your payment by Tuesday at noon, your package will go out Wednesday night and ship Thursday morning. We stick to this schedule because we both work regular jobs and have to maintain some kind of normalcy in our schedules. Please inspect your package as soon as it arrives and keep ALL packaging. If the shipper causes damage in transit, you will have to present your packaging as proof when you make your claim. I do not give refunds or exchanges on things damaged in shipping-- you'll have to file a claim with the shipper. I will provide whatever supporting information I can in order to help. I guarantee that things are as-advertised, so if there is an issue, please email me and I'll do my best to fix the problem. Please contact me first if you feel that my service is so poor that I deserve negative or neutral feedback. Sometimes email fails and I'll miss a message, but I always strive to make my customers happy. Let me know if there are problems and I'll try to fix them. One last thing-- do NOT ask me to ship things that aren't media by the USPS media rate. I won't lie and break a federal law to save you ten bucks. I'm here to run a clean business and enjoy the eBay community. Let's keep it friendly and professional.

    <Description>Scripophily Makes a Great Gift for Everyone Our Stocks are worth the paper they're printed on (sm) Our Company is a TRUSTED Buyer and Seller of Old Stock Certificates. Check out our About Me Page , where you can find out about us and read the recent articles about our company in Time Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, The Globe and Mail, Washington Post and our appearence on CNN. Beautifully engraved Certificate from the famous The Tonopah Mining Company of Nevada issued in the 1950's. This historic document was printed by the Security Banknote Company and has an ornate border around it with a vignette of miners working inside of a shaft. This item is hand signed by the company's president and is over 44 years old. Massive doses of capital and labor again brought Nevada rapidly to its feet. During the 1900 census, Goldfield's (Esmeralda County) population was recorded at only 1,972 persons. Within five years, this isolated mining community had swelled to between 25,000 and 30,000 persons and was by far the largest city in Nevada. Nearly just as quickly, however, the Goldfield mining boom began its inevitable downward spiral, dropping the city's population to 9,369 persons recorded by 1910 and to only 2,410 person by the time of the 1920 census, 810 persons fewer than had been recorded in the 1880 population census for Esmeralda County. Thirty miles to the north of Goldfield, the town of Tonopah (in Nye County) also boomed from local gold discoveries, with its population exploding from only 1,140 persons in 1900 to 7,513 persons by 1910. In a burst of civic-mindedness, Wyatt Earp, having gained legendary notoriety for his Tombstone, Arizona, and OK Corral exploits, established a bar and tobacco store to share in the riches of the City of Tonopah, thus renouncing his somewhat checkered past. (Fortunately, the town fared better than Earp, who was arrested two years later in Los Angeles on fraud charges.) Nevada Historical Marker 101 Location: Central Region, Esmeralda County, Nevada. Located on U.S. Highway 95, thirteen miles north of Tonopah, Nevada. MILLER'S As a result of the mining excitement at Tonopah in 1901 and subsequent construction of the Tonopah and Goldfield Railroad, Miller's was founded in 1904 as a station and watering stop on that line. The name honors Charles R. Miller, a director of the railroad and former Governor of Delaware. He was also vice president of the Tonopah Mining Company and was instrumental in having their 100- stamp cyanide mill build here in 1906. In 1907 the town boomed with the construction of the T &amp; G Railroad's repair shops and another large mill. Boasting a business district and post office, the population grew to 274 in 1910. By 1911, the railroad shops and a mill had been moved away, and Miller's began to decline. It was abandoned in 1947 when the railroad went out of business. This Authentic certificate looks great framed and is much nicer in person than the scan indicates.

The bowl measures a generous 10" in diameter and almost 6" high and has a nice elegant shape with the ever - popular ribbed exterior. It's in perfect condition save for a bit of wear in the glaze on the lip. It's not chipped but I think was just worn away a bit over the many decades its been around! There is also a small chip on the foot on the underside portion of the bowl that is not visible and does not affect the bowl in any way. This is a gorgeous bowl and would make an incredible gift!

    <Description>Vintage Doll - Breton Man My friend with the teddy bears also has a doll collection that she has asked me to dispose of. All of these dolls were purchased in the late fifties, early sixties and so are at least 40 years old. Since I am not a collector, I will try to describe the dolls as best I can and rely on the photographs to convey most of the information. As always, please feel free to get in touch with me if you have any questions concerning this or any other auction I might have on eBay. Enjoy the auctions. This auction is for a doll from Brittany. He has a plastic body but his face, instead of being generic, has a definite masculine aspect. The features have been painted on. He is a bit over 8 inches tall and has a wonderful, traditional suit on with striped grey pants, a greyish blue sash, a vest and jacket over his white shirt. The outfit is completed by a ribbon tie, a watch chain and a wide brimmed felt hat with a hat band that matches his tie in colour and design. This is definitely an older, collector's doll and I have a small reserve on this one. I have several other dolls listed presently on eBay so, you might want to check my other auctions. Thank you. Terms and Conditions Winning bidder should get in touch with me within three days. People not following up on their bids will automatically get negative feedback. Merchandise is guaranteed to be as described. Should a potential bidder have any questions, please feel free to get in touch with me.

    <Description>Vintage Doll - Regional French Doll My friend with the teddy bears also has a doll collection that she has asked me to dispose of. All of these dolls were purchased in the late fifties, early sixties and so are at least 40 years old.

As always, please feel free to get in touch with me if you have any questions concerning this or any other auction I might have on eBay. Enjoy the auctions. This auction is for a French doll in a Regional costume. France is divided into regions I am not quite certain along what criteria and each region has its own traditional costume such as Brittany, Normandy and so on. It's a bit like if each state in the U.S. had its own costume. Unfortunately, I don't know which region this doll comes from and can't devote the time for research. My friend can't quite remember...So, I leave it up to you. I would appreciate it if anyone who knows would get in touch with me. These are beautiful dolls and definitely collectors' items. This one is a bit over 6 1/4 inches tall and has a plastic body. She has a nice, somewhat different face with painted on features and brown hair. Her costume consists of underpants, a crinoline or petticoat, a striped blue and white skirt with an embroidered ribbon as well as a metallic gold ribbon decoration at the bottom. a black bodice with a red shawl decorated with gold lace, a beautiful, embroidered apron with metallic gold lace on the edge and a cotton coif with lace around the edge. Truly, a beautiful doll. . Due to the quality of this doll, I have a small reserve on it. I have several other dolls listed presently on eBay so, you might want to check my other auctions. Thank you.

    <Description>Description: The 1950's vintage flamingo set is marked on the bottom of the dish, and incised: "Los Angeles Potteries 100", which was one of the early California pottery companies. The flamingos are not marked, but were actually standing in water in the dish when we purchased them, and because of the identical style, I have no doubt this is a set. The bowl measures 8 1/2 wide by 11 long and 2 1/2" high. The exterior is light pink on the bottom and deep pink coloring as you reach the edge. The interior is gray with black as you reach the edge, and the very oval in the center bottom is pink. The flamingo which has its head down measures 7 1/4" tall, and the standing bird measures 10" tall. They have a high gloss finish, and are done in deep pink with black highlights, and have green leafy bases. The detail is excellent and the quality of the painting is suburb. The flamingos are in excellent condition, no chips, no cracks, no crazing, and no scuffing. The dish has a large chip on the left and a minor one on the right corner edge, and it has crazing. We include a shipping price for all three items, but if you choose to take only the flamingos, it will be less. Over the years I've had a number of these flamingos, but never complete with the dish! It's a beautiful set. Condition, Payment and Shipping Info: Condition of Item: If item is NOT as described, we offer full refund, less shipping, if RETURNED WITHIN 5 DAYS. Postage Costs: USA buyers include $4.50 for box, packing, plus shipping. We carefully pack and box all items, however we suggest Insurance: Uninsured shipments are at the risk of the buyer. We ship WORLDWIDE, but shipping to Canada and overseas is more! Multiple purchases shipped together to save postage. Your Payment: Your payment to be received WITHIN 10 DAYS of auction end. Cash, check, money order and BidPay.com accepted. (Sorry, we do NOT accept PayPal from USA buyers; we can accept PayPal only from Canadian and overseas bidders.) Shipping: We ship your item within 5 days of receipt of your cash or money order. (CHECKS must clear MY BANK before shipment: usually 10-14 days!) Shipped via USPS (U.S. mail).

    <Description>CANON N650U USB FLATBED SCANNER 600 x 1200 dpi, 42-Bit w/Z-Lid Great Scanning at a Great Price: The groundbreaking CanoScan N650U USB Flatbed Scanner launches a new era in scanning performance, innovation and value-giving you the power to do so much more, for so much less. Small Wonder: At just over one inch high, the N650U scanner is one of the thinnest flatbed scanners in the world. It's also one of the easiest to set up and use. Connect with just a single USB cable to any compatible Mac_ or PC-no power cord or bulky transformers are necessary. Just plug it in to your computer and scan photos, graphics, copy and more at a remarkable 600 x 1200 dpi for crisp, clear images. Plus, 42-bit resolution gives you over four trillion possible colors for richer, more robust scans. It even has an external programmable button for fast, one-touch scanning. Scanning bulky items is easier then ever: Canon's exclusive Z-Lid Expansion Top will change the way you scan bulky items, such as books and magazines. Many other scanner covers lift only at an angle and become uneven and awkward when scanning anything that isn't completely flat. The N650U scanner includes a special expansion hinge that lifts up to one inch vertically allowing the lid to lie flat, creating the space needed for bulky items. Features: Exclusive Z-Lid_ Expansion Top 600 x 1200 dpi resolution One cable for USB and power 42-bit for over 4 trillion possible colors Ultra-slim-just over 1 inch high Software: ScanGear CS-U TWAIN driver, ScanGear Toolbox CS, Canon Plug-in Module CS-U, CanoScan Toolbox CS, ArcSoft_ PhotoStudio_ 2000, ArcSoft PhotoBase_ and ScanSoft_ OmniPage_ OCR Manufacturer Part Number F91-4631-US1 Warranty: This is a factory refurbished item and comes with a 90 day warranty through Canon Shipping: There is a $10.00 shipping and handling charge for all shipments within the continental US.

    <Description>The lovely little Goebel Cardinal Tuck salt and peppers measure 2 1/2" in height and each bears the Goebel 'bee in a vee" mark and 'w. germany.' One has a Cardinal Tuck label on the back. The pepper is in mint condition, and the salt has a couple of little chips at the bottom front that makes it look like his white shoes are sticking out from under his robe. This problem can be touched-up easily, but we usually leave that to the taste of the purchaser. Please email me if you have any questions. And see our other auctions for more unusual collectibles.

These were possibly part of a lazy susan set, but could be used as small salad bowls or snack servers. They measure approximately 5 7/8" across at their widest point. Two of these have small chips on the point of one leaf, one has a chip on the back of the leaf and one is free of damage. High bidder to include additional charges for Shipping/Handling/Insurance.

    <Description>Hello - I am liquidating most of my stock to make room for other collectibles. This auction is for Marie, issued in 1993, and retired in 1999. She is a girl bear, wearing a bonnet, and has a tea set laid out in front of her. She has the third marking available (4HH4/504). She is in mint condition, and comes with the original box. However, all I have is the certificate of adoption, since I was stupid enough to mail the other part away. Also, I do not have the original wrapping for her, but, she will be very securely wrapped when shipped to you. PayPal and BidPay accepted for credit cards. Buyer pays $5.00 insured shipping costs in the USA. Shipping will be adjusted for other countries. Check out my other auctions to save on shipping. Thank you and good luck bidding.</Description>

    <Description>HELLO KITTY Cube Frenzy NEW! for Playstation ITEM DESCRIPTION: HELLO KITTY Cube Frenzy NEW! NEW NEW NEW!!! NEVER BEEN OPENED! This is a Brand New sealed original black bottom disc. The game is really fun. A must-have for collectors of Hello Kitty and puzzle game fanatics alike. The following is a review from Mark Kanarick writer for the All Game Guide Hello Kitty makes her way on to the PlayStation with Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy. The adorable kitty, whose popularity among little girls came in the form of plush toys, pencils, backpacks and other merchandise. Are you ready to help her solve puzzles in her first PlayStation title? As Hello Kitty, the popular Japanese character, you move her by making cubes disappear or piling them up in order to get her to collect prizes. After clearing a land, you get to choose where you want to go, changing the story. The story begins when Hello Kitty falls asleep at a beach resort. When she wakes up she finds herself on a strange island surrounded by the smell of flowers. She realizes that her archenemy, Badtz-Maru has played a trick on her and she has been transported to another world. To get back home she has to make it through eleven different lands, each consisting of three stages. There are three modes including: the Story mode; the Extra mode, which appears after you clear all the lands; and the Free Play mode, which allows you to play whatever levels you want either alone, with a partner or against a partner. The game also features a bonus round and cute illustrations of Hello Kitty. Hello Kitty's Cube Frenzy is also available on the Game Boy Color, but this PlayStation version uses one block of memory and has vibration feedback compatibility. MAKES A GREAT GIFT !

T. Fischer (see photo of signature). Born in Dresden, Germany, Mr. Fischer emigrated to the United States in 1904 and immediately began work at the Pickard studio. This piece bears the 13/32" brown decal used by Pickard China from 1905 to 1910 (see photo of mark). The piece is 7 1/2" wide from open handle to open handle. It is a very shallow bowl shape, probably intended for mints. The piece is in excellent condition, without any cracks, chips, or restoration. Some of the gold paint decoration is raised to give the piece depth and texture; one of the small, slightly raised gold beads of paint that you see on the black border is partially gone, revealing white glaze beneath. A lovely example of this important artist's work that will grace your Pickard collection. With over 25 years experience selling antiques by mail order and on Ebay, we stand behind our merchandise.

It has the Heirloom flower pattern in the center, 4 grooves for cigarettes to lay in and is in absolute mint condition. Even if YOU don't smoke, you may have a friend or relative who does, and won't it be nice to have a matching ashtray for them after dinner?

Below, I have outlined a little bit about me and the terms under which I sell my items. Please take a moment to look them over and I hope you enjoy bidding. WHERE DO MY ITEMS COME FROM ? I spend my time searching high and low looking for great deals that I can pass on to the nice people on eBay. The items come from Auctions, Flea Markets, Tag Sales, Going out of Business Liquidations, Second Hand and Pawn Shops. I check all of the items once and twice over before investing my hard earned money into them because these are usually one of a kind and all sales final. On the more expensive and technical items, I always have them checked over by professionals before the listing is made. HOW DO I SHIP, AND WHEN WILL YOU GET IT ? Like you, I buy lots of things on eBay and I know that when I do I want to receive the item as soon as possible, know that it is on its way, and get it in one piece. To this end, I use UPS ground. They may not be as cheap as some others, but they get the job done consistently and allow me to ship almost every day. Also, when I ship items, the recipients get a email that provides them with a tracking # and link to track their item. This tracking system is very accurate and in my opinion is far superior to the one that the Post Office uses. FLAT RATE SHIPPING AND HANDLING FOR THIS ITEM IS $22.30 The price that I am charging for the shipping is Flat Rate for the Continental United States and constitutes all of the costs of shipping and handling the package. That includes, not only the postage fee, but the box, packing media, tape, labels, printer supplies, and labor to pay someone to pack your item with the care that you can expect from me Buyers outside of the continental US must pay one and a half % of the stated shipping price to cover the higher price of shipping to those locations. I will ship to Canada, but be aware that I will not submit documents with false item descriptions or values to save you money on taxes, or be responsible for brokerage fees and delays. HOW DO I ACCEPT PAYMENTS ? I accept Credit Cards through Pay Pal, Money Orders &amp; Cashiers Checks. I give my buyers up to 7 days to get their payment to me after the auction ends. I reserve the right to resell items not paid for by that time and return late payments CREDIT CARD CUSTOMERS PLEASE NOTE If you are not already a registered PayPal user, please note that PayPal allows credit card transactions up to only $250.00 until your account is verified. After that, you can charge more. The verification process usually takes 2 days. If you are bidding on this item and your bid will total over $250.00 including shipping, you may want to sign up for PayPal now to expedite your order. There is no purchase or obligation necessary WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH THE ITEM THAT YOU BUY I give buyers 7 days to inspect their purchase. In the unlikley event that there is a problem with it, I will either fix the item or refund your money upon the prompt return of the item. New items are sold as new and as I am not a dealer defects must be taken up through the product warranty. View and search all the items in my picture gallery Auctiva PowerTools .

    <Description>Pearl Harbor Prop Two Bamboo Parasols Click here to see larger view of the item Click here to see a second picture of the item This pair of red bamboo parasols were among several used as props in the Touchstone Pictures war epic "Pearl Harbor," starring Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale. "Pearl Harbor" is a Jerry Bruckheimer production of a Michael Bay film, coming to video and DVD December 4, 2001. MATERIALS: bamboo/paper CONDITION: Items may exhibit some wear from regular use and handling during film production and subsequent storage, including small tears in the paper. DISCLAIMER: These items are being auctioned as decorative collectibles only and are not intended for any other purpose or use. &amp;nbsp Holiday delivery of this item is not guaranteed. A Certificate of Authenticity will be sent to the winning bidder under separate cover. On a sleepy Sunday morning in December, as children played and families prayed, squadrons of Japanese warplanes screamed across the skies of a Hawaiian paradise and launched a surprise attack on the U.S. armed forces at Pearl Harbor. The infamous day that jolted America from peaceful isolationism to total war and altered the course of history is relived in this epic tale of patriotism, passion and romance from producer Jerry Bruckheimer, producer-director Michael Bay and screenwriter Randall Wallace. "Pearl Harbor" focuses on the life-changing events surrounding December 7, 1941, and the war's devastating impact on two daring young pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) and a beautiful, dedicated nurse (Kate Beckinsale). It is a tale of catastrophic defeat, heroic victory and overwhelming love set against a stunning backdrop of spectacular wartime action. Click here to calculate shipping charges. All sales are final.

    <Description>You are bidding on an original release 11x14 lobby card for the 1935 Warner Brothers comedy "The Irish In Us" directed by Lloyd Bacon. It pictures James Cagney, Allen Jenkins and Olivia DeHavilland. Condition is very nice (pinholes in the corners, a couple of light marks). Someone put a thumbtack in Jenkins' cheek, so there was a small hole and a dent. You can barely make it out on the photo - we repaired it afterwards. Overall, the card looks very presentable. Postage is $7.00 in the U.S. NY residents please add sales tax. You can view items up for auction at our gallery at 133 E. 58th St. (10th floor) in NYC. Good luck!

    <Description>Alfred Hitchcock Autographed Movie photo 1963 Alfred Hitchcock signed Movie Photograph "The Birds." Photograph Size: 8 X 10 Movie: "The Birds." This is a remarkable and Rare Signed Photograph for the serious collector of celebrity autographs. The Signatures Grades a 10 out of 10. Signed in Black ink with a drawing image of himself. Condition of Photograph is Excellent with minor creasing, corner chipping and a faint yellow line that extends across the photo. Overall, in remarkable condition. The image is " Crystal Clear." This is one of the very best Alfred Hitchcock signed Photograph that we have offered in a while. This would be a great addition to any serious movie memorabilia collection. Hitchcock's first film, produced in 1927 garnered mixed reactions. The Lodger, which centered on a boarder who was suspected of murdering several women, harvested both critical and pubic acclaim. Yet some moviegoers were shocked by its aberrant content. The Lodger focused on such dismal topics such as murder, suspicion, and even touched upon sexual attraction. This film was prepared in the painstaking style for which Hitchcock became famous. He was dedicated to his art from the very beginning of his career. He even created storyboards with mock-ups of every shot in a film before shooting. Hitchcock had directed a total of nine silent films and was one of Britain's leading directors when he made his first partially sound film, Blackmail, in 1929. Thirteen Hitchcock sound films followed, including Murder! (1930), The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) The 39 Steps (1935), Sabotage (1936), and The Lady Vanishes (1938). By this point he had become known as Britain's top film director. Hitchcock journeyed to America in 1939, believing he would have more creative freedom. His first American film, Rebecca (1940) won an Academy Award for best film. Ironically, Hitchcock never did receive a best director award for this film, or for any of the other four films which were nominated over the years. In America, Hitchcock was cranking out more than one movie a year, but this prolific nature abated after his direction of Psycho in 1960. Just a few of his classic pictures of this period were Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946), Strangers on a Train (1951), Rear Window (1954), The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), Vertigo (1958), and North by Northwest (1959), all of which were concerned murder and/or espionage and their effect on personal and social relationships. After the 1940 s, Hitchcock made good on his promise to himself to begin producing films as well as directing them. However, as a result of his unending public appeal, Hitchcock did not attract the serious critical attention he deserved. Like many writers, artists and celebrities, Hitchcock created an aura of mystery around himself, rarely revealing anything to interviewers that was more in depth than list of technical tales about the challenge of shooting various scenes. Yet he obviously enjoyed the appreciation of other filmmakers and considered self-promotion to be one of the keys to his professional success. The only film aside from The Birds and Psycho that was financially successful in Hitchcock s later years was Frenzy (1972), a tale of a psychopathic murderer who could only combat his impotence by strangling women to death. Some critics accused that Hitchcock's later films lacked the dynamic power that his earlier works emanated. Some even began to downplay Hitchcock's role in his earlier successes, claiming that the screenwriters Hitchcock employed were responsible for giving his films' characters realistic personalities and motivations. Most of the western world, however, regards Alfred Hitchcock as The Master of Suspense. Throughout his long career, Hitchcock made 53 feature-length films, he worked with scores of actors, including Ingrid Bergman and Grace Kelly, not to mention technicians, composers, publicists and studio administrators, and he created some of America's most popular and cherished films to date. Yet he frequently complained about his loneliness and his fear of death, even as he was still hailed, even in the last moments of his life, as one of the film industry s greatest directors of all time. Perhaps the darkness of his nature not only led Alfred Hitchcock to attain worldwide acclaim, but also prevented him from enjoying it. Hitchcock's first film, produced in 1927 garnered mixed reactions. The Lodger, which centered on a boarder who was suspected of murdering several women, harvested both critical and pubic acclaim. Yet some moviegoers were shocked by its aberrant content. The Lodger focused on such dismal topics such as murder, suspicion, and even touched upon sexual attraction. This film was prepared in the painstaking style for which Hitchcock became famous. He was dedicated to his art from the very beginning of his career. He even created storyboards with mock-ups of every shot in a film before shooting. Hitchcock had directed a total of nine silent films and was one of Britain's leading directors when he made his first partially sound film, Blackmail, in 1929. Thirteen Hitchcock sound films followed, including Murder! (1930), The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934) The 39 Steps (1935), Sabotage (1936), and The Lady Vanishes (1938). By this point he had become known as Britain's top film director. Hitchcock journeyed to America in 1939, believing he would have more creative freedom. His first American film, Rebecca (1940) won an Academy Award for best film. Ironically, Hitchcock never did receive a best director award for this film, or for any of the other four films which were nominated over the years. In America, Hitchcock was cranking out more than one movie a year, but this prolific nature abated after his direction of Psycho in 1960. Just a few of his classic pictures of this period were Shadow of a Doubt (1943), Notorious (1946), Strangers on a Train (1951), Rear Window (1954), The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), Vertigo (1958), and North by Northwest (1959), all of which were concerned murder and/or espionage and their effect on personal and social relationships. After the 1940 s, Hitchcock made good on his promise to himself to begin producing films as well as directing them. However, as a result of his unending public appeal, Hitchcock did not attract the serious critical attention he deserved. Like many writers, artists and celebrities, Hitchcock created an aura of mystery around himself, rarely revealing anything to interviewers that was more in depth than list of technical tales about the challenge of shooting various scenes. Yet he obviously enjoyed the appreciation of other filmmakers and considered self-promotion to be one of the keys to his professional success.

    <Description>urns Click here for more detail images Antique French Marble Bronze Urn Urns Swan NR Dimensions, Weight: Height 18 inches. Diameter at widest point ca. 22 inches. Width from outer tip of one swan handle to the other ca. 11 inches. Each urn weighs ca. 40 pounds. Description: (This item has been re-listed due to a non-respondent bidder.) This is an elegant pair of marble urns with bronze mounts, created in the best of the French tradition! They were probably made in Paris in the early 19th century. (See History below.) They would make an exquisite holiday gift for any connoisseur of fine French antiques! The subtle marbelling of rich, cocoa browns and creams is sophisticated and refined. (The colors in the photos are very accurate, depending on variance in monitors.) The proportions and embellishments are elegant. This kind of marble is simply no longer available to sculptors of today! The marble just sings of age and beauty rarely found today! (See the History section below for further discussion of the age of the urns.) The bronze mounts of swans and garlands are of a transitional period design: between the neo-classical design of the Louis XVI and Directoire periods and the subsequent Consulate style at the end of the 18th century, which anticipated the later Empire style. The fine bronze casting has nice depth and crisp details. Deeply carved garlands of laurel leaves with berries and roses are draped around the urn. Two layers of acanthus leaves decorate the base. A pair of slender swans holds the garlands at each side. These details are punctuated by palm leaves and acorn finials at the top. Condition: The urns are in excellent condition with minimal signs of wear! The bronze mounts have a wonderful soft patina. Just a very tiny piece of the tip of one garland has been broken off where it meets the mouth of the swan: this does not detract since it is not noticeable unless pointed out. (See detail image.) This tiny flaw can also be restored, if desired; though purists might prefer to leave this unrestored. So, we leave that decision up to the buyer and have factored this into the price of the urns. The urns are otherwise in wonderful condition for their age!! History: The beginnings of the transition to the Directoire and Consulate styles began in 1789, during the latter part of the reign of Louis XVI, and continued up to the full development of the Empire style of Napolean's reign, which began in 1799. The new style was only created by artisans in Paris at the time. (Artisans in the provinces at this time continued to use the styles of the Louis XIV - Louis XVI period, as they struggled to recover from the destruction of the Revolution period.) This should date the urns to somewhere between 1793 and 1799 or shortly thereafter. Accordingly, the urns are likely to have been made in Paris at the end of the 18th century or early in the 19th century. Berthault, the furniture designer for newlywed and stylemaker Madame Recamier, was one of the first to use this bronze swan motif, while decorating her apartments in the exclusive Marais district of Paris , which is still so popular for its style today. His design for her solid mahogany bed, which was the highlight of the house, was sumptuously decorated with sculptured gilt bronze swans. It was one of the first beds designed in this manner and became immensely influential. Its swans and allegorical motifs of night were copied by innumerable furniture makers. The swan would come to be a symbol of the new Consulate style. The browns of the marble on these urns and their bronze swan handles would have fit very appropriately into a turn of the 19th century room such as this. They would be equally at home in your Paris apartment! Please ask questions before bidding , as it is very important to me that you are completely satisfied with your purchase!

    <Description>ELKE SOMMER - 4x5 color transparency Click image to view larger version From the files of a journalist, recently deceased, who began covering Hollywood in 1945. The sources were many and varied -- studios, networks, production companies, agencies, his own photographers and sometimes himself -- and were used to illustrate his articles. These have just lately been rescued from badly deteriorating plastic sleeves and placed in archival quality poly. Original captions, photographer's credits &amp; production numbers still existing have been preserved, and are either attached to the outside of the archival poly or are tucked inside. In most cases, the quality is excellent with surprisingly minimal color shift. This is a 4x5 color transparency of drop dead gorgeous ELKE SOMMER from sometime back in the 60's. As you can see, she is in a bikini which is a good thing, and appears to be shampooing a small dog in a swimming pool which is probably a good thing for the dog. The photo was taken by Carp. Whether this was from one of her movies, I know not.

This poster measures 12x18 and is professionaly framed with a wooden frame. Matte glass to prevent glare and reduce reflection. Vincent price plays a millionaire taken advantage of by his spoiled wife. He invites five people to spend the night in his haunted mansion. The survivors will win a handsome sum of money if they live.

All of our movie posters are movie posters-, no reprints, reproductions, or video posters.

On the other hand they may be perfectly unpunctured mint- we got all sorts. Some posters have censorship labels on them, these can be removed with warm water, personally I leave them on- more authentic... For further details or questions please email us.

Why not buy some more and save on your shipping- ideal Christmas present for that strange friend or loved one. Shipping is US$5 per poster worldwide air.

    <Description>VALENTINO ORIGINAL MOTION PICTURE SOUNDTRACK _NUREYEV IS VALENTINO_ Valentino _ Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. Album Produced by Ken Russell. Arranged and Conducted by Stanley Black. c1977, United Artists Records Stereo LP #UA-LA810-8-0698. The album opens to a large full-length photo of a reclining, nearly-nude Rudolf Nureyev in body paint. Valentino is director Ken Russell_s visually flamboyant biography of the great screen lover Rudolph Valentino, played by ballet legend Rudolf Nureyev. Film credits: Directed by Ken Russell; Produced by Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff; Written by Ken Russell and Mardik Martin; With Rudolf Nureyev, Leslie Caron, Michelle Phillips, and Carol Kane. As far as I know, this album is NOT available on CD. Tracks: Daybreak (Tango) The Sheik of Araby (Vocal: Chris Ellis) Dark Eyes On the Trail Deep Nocturne Fatty_s One Step / The World_s Fair Suite El Choclo Pink Powder Puff (The Sheik of Araby) There_s a New Star In Heaven Tonight (Rudolph Valentino) (Vocal: Richard Day-Lewis) Daybreak (Prelude) Requiem / Camille Tango / On the Trail Legend of Meselope / Desert Rhapsody / The Painted Desert June_s Fantasy (_Sunset_ from Grand Canyon Suite) Lorna_s Fantasy (Sheik of Araby) S_ance Daybreak (Finale) All the LPs I am selling are from my parents_ collection and are sold _as is_ since I have not listened to them. This LP is in a paper sleeve inside the album cover, and the inner paper sleeve is split in the middle at the bottom, but not all the way across. The LP itself looks to me to be in Very Good condition, with some dust, finger marks, and light scratches _ but overall shows little wear. The cover is in Good condition_ rubbed, with edge and corner wear, and some splitting at the top and bottom of the spine_but otherwise it is clean, bright, and solid. High bidder pays packing and shipping charges ($3.23 for Media Mail or $6.20 for Priority Mail in the U.S., add $1.10 for insurance if desired _ Shipping and insurance charges outside the U.S. will vary and will be calculated based on the winning bidder's location).

    <Description>Hey Richard Hatch / Lorne Greene / Jane Seymour / Dirk Benedict Fans! This is a Japanese movie program for BATTLESTAR GALACTICA . It measures 8.5" by 11", is printed on HEAVY STOCK paper and is CHOCK FULL OF BEAUTIFUL COLOR PICS! Please see the scans below for an idea. When movies are released theatrically in Japan, souvenir programs are sold at the theater. The programs are like magazines which feature color pictures as well as b&amp;w photos, and lots of accompanying text (mostly in Japanese). What makes these programs so unique is that they feature a lot of pics (from the film as well as publicity shots) that aren't commonly available. Movie programs are a big collectible in Japan, and for good reason: they're QUALITY mementos of your favorite films. They go for big bucks over there, but there is NO RESERVE on this auction! Please see our other auctions for more programs of classic films. Winners of multiple program auctions save a ton on shipping (just one shipping charge) and receive a 5% discount off their entire order! Please take note of our feedback: We pride ourselves on service! We ship 5 days a week and try to make all transactions speedy! Direct shipping from the USA! We accept payment by check or money order. Payment must be received within 10 days of the end of the auction. Personal checks take 10 days to clear, money orders and bank checks are processed ASAP. Winner pays $4.00 for shipping within the US. International shipping will cost more. CA residents please add 8% sales tax. Please e-mail with any questions (deelu@hotmail.com). Please wait for all the pictures to load, you won't regret it. Thanks for looking and thanks for bidding! NOTE: Please don't bid if you have multiple negative feedback. Also, if you have zero feedback, please e-mail us first before bidding. Due to the high number of flakey bidders, we reserve the right to cancel any bids we deem to be risky.

This is an original script, Not a reproduction. This is the final shooting script from the 1998 Movie classic " THE TRUMAN SHOW ". The red cardboard cover has the following information: Title, Screenplay (written directly for the screen) written by Andrew Niccol , Paramount pictures. There are 107pgs to this script a real beauty! and in excellent condition.Truman Show, The (1998) TRUMAN SHOW... Directed by Peter Weir Writing credits (WGA) Andrew Niccol (written by) Genre: Fantasy / Comedy / Drama / Sci-Fi Plot Outline:Truman Burbank is a normal man, living in a normal town. He grew up to be a desk clerk for a insurance company, living an ordinary life, having an ordinary wife, an ordinary neighbour and an ordinary bud, who pops in from time to time with a sixpack. But Truman is not happy with his life. He wants to see the world. He wants to get away from his happy-happy, ever tidy, nice'n'shiny little island town at the seaside. In reality, Truman was an unwanted pregnancy. His "father", Christof, a reckless TV-Producer whom he never met, made up the Truman Show - the greatest show on earth - a show in which life is live. So, everyone around poor Truman is an actor with a little headphone in the ear. One day, Truman accidentally bumps into a catering area backstage and gets pretty suspicious. His plan now is: Pretend to be sleeping and steal away... A True American Classic When I first saw 'The Truman Show' I came out of the theatre amazed. This is your first clue that you are watching something different from your normal Jim Carrey movie. I love the dialogue, camera shot, performances, direction, music, and running time of this movie. There is nothing I would do to change it. I came away from 'The Truman Show' feeling inspired which is the goal of good filmmaking Jim Carrey was outstanding as Truman, underplaying him, not making him too comic or too dramatic, but giving true sincerity when asked. He deserved an Oscar nomination. Ed Harris has always been a good actor, but in this movie he's a great actor. He plays Christof with such arrogance and bullheadedness that you don't know whether he's helping or destroying Truman. He and the director, Peter Weir, deserved their Oscar nods. Weir, who directed the great 'Witness', uses different camera angles to make you feel like you're actually watching 'The Truman Show' and not a movie. He ends it before you get tired of the concept and helped Carrey and Harris give immaculate performances. Andrew Niccol script is a real star in the movie too because of it's inventiveness and ingenuity. Overall, 'The Truman Show' is what I like to call a true American classic. Cast overview, first billed only: Jim Carrey .... Truman Burbank Laura Linney .... Meryl/Hanna Gill Noah Emmerich .... Marlon/Louis Coltrane Natascha McElhone .... Lauren Garland/Sylvia Holland Taylor .... Angela Burbank, Truman's Mother Brian Delate .... Kirk Burbank, Truman's Father Blair Slater .... Young Truman Peter Krause (I) ....
