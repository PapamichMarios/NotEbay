This coat is a Braetan Kids, Made in Ukraine, it is trimmed out in a velvety material and has a bow in the back and a matching hat. My daughter when she was this size was very cute in this coat, it is a perfect dress coat for any occasion. This coat had very little wear, and has just been dry cleaned. It was bought brand new and has been outgrown. The coat comes from a smoke free home and has no rips, tears, etc. in it, has all of it's buttons and bows and basically has been used very little. I will be happy to answer any emailed questions about this coat, winning bidder to pay actual shipping charges only, I prefer to ship Priority Mail.

    <Description>This coat is made by Corky &amp; Company - Authentic Flight Gear. I just love it!! The fabric is a thick fleece (but the knap is much longer than regular fleece). The under part of the coat is a brown plaid, with white running through it. On top of that, is an attached vest and hood in a solid brown. The front of the coat has two pockets. The inside is all lined with the matching brown plaid fabric. Such a warm and cuddly coat. It reminds me of a teddy bear. My son wore it last year for a total of probably 10 times. If you have any questions, please e-mail me. High bidder to pay $6 shipping.</Description>

Made in Canada by Big Steel Man. It has classic styling such as double breasted with 2 rows of buttons, buttoned shoulder tabs, front over flaps and back yoke, buttoned tabs on the sleeve tabs, buckled belt and a long slit in back. There are 2 deep side pockets. One button is missing, so you might need to replace all of them, but you could probably get away with moving down one of the top buttons that is mostly covered with fur, and a mismatched button wouldn't be as noticeable up here. Size is given as 40, but please go by the measurements. Chest is 42". Shoulder width is 17". Sleeve length is 26 1/2". Length is 46". Lining is a heavy black satin. It is coming apart a few inches along the seams and will need a quick repair. Condition is EXCELLENT. There is a few inches of stitching which has come out under one sleeve. This should be easy to fix. NO RESERVE Shipping from Canada can take between 10 to 17 business days going through regular postal services due to customs, so please be patient.

    <Description>Up for auction are a wonderful pair of extremely sexy high heel pumps in brilliant red-orange color leather. The two 20" long straps wrap around your ankle and wow! The toe is cut very open to show all of your carefully manicured toes with four little straps to help hold these beautiful shoes on! They are all leather and made in Paris, France by Charles Jourdan. The picture tells it all! The back of the heel measures 4" and the shoe is a size 7 1/2 B or 38. These shoes have only been worn a few times with absolutely no wear on the heel tips! I am also listing two other pairs identical in design, but one is a hot pink (only worn a couple of times) and the other is a beige leather made to look like cork (never worn). The wonderful thing about these shoes is that they can tie around your ankle or up your leg. They are really special! I have also listed a couple of evening gowns that would go great with these shoes. Please check my other auctions I will be adding this week. I will have lots of jewelry and wonderful vintage handbags and shoes, some holiday dresses, two digital prints of my farm house paintings, each in an unusual wood frame printed with a Warren Kimble country farm house painting. Shipping is by priority mail, I include tracking. Insurance is optional. Please pay electronically or with a money order or cashier's check. If you have over 150 positive feedbacks, I'll accept a check. Please email with any questions. Thanks for looking and happy bidding!</Description>

    <Description>This is a really nice Womens Size Medium Navy Blue Blazer that would look good with pants or skirt at work or with Jeans for the casual look. It really hugs the figure with two darts in the front (7" long on both sides) and two in the back (14" long-start about a third of the way down and go all the way to the hem). The tag says it is made by Classica. There doesn't appear to be a tag saying what the fabric is but it feels like wool and is completely lined with what feels like a soft shiny fabric that matches the navy in the Blazer. There is a tag that says Professionally Dry Clean Only. It has one slit breast pocket (which is still sewn shut), two front slit pockets that are open and a single front button. The sleeves are 24" from the shoulder seam and at the cuff of each sleeve there are four buttons in a vertical row a little smaller than the one front button. The length of the blazer from top of back to hem is 25". S&amp;H is actual or $3.50 for Priority Mail. Please email any questions.</Description>

Unfortunately, these people do not understand that it costs money to list items on Ebay. Please remember that if you win an auction that Ebay considers it a binding contract. Otherwise, if you back out, I have no choice but to leave negative feedback. Additionally, if you have questions, please email me BEFORE bidding. Thanks for understanding! :) Very Important Remember not to do any things that harm you or other people and don't make any babies cry unless they are jerks. GOOD LUCK AND HAPPY BIDDING!

    <Description>Brand new, gray (herringbone pattern), singlebreasted, Ermenegildo Zegna "High Performance" sportcoat. Euro size 58L. 100% wool with cupro bemberg lining. Partially lined. Double vents in the back. Three button front. Made in Italy (rather than Switzerland where most Zegna comes from). Classic Italian "Gangster" cut. Unbelievable craftsmanship throughout. This is a straight Zegna, not a Zegna "soft", so the size runs a little smaller than the "soft" line. $1,175 retail tag still attached. This is one sweet jacket. Paypal gets it to you in time for Christmas. Questions: wanghj@attglobal.net Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>Brand NEW beautiful ladies skirt, size 22 made by _Rdyne &amp; Diane_. This skirt features a pleated front completing the charming look of this skirt. The skirt does have a flap that in a sense wraps-around the wearer _ therefore there is a lovely large gold safety pin for added securement. Very Chic! It is perfect for the office or for an evening out on the town! Made from 75% Polyester/25% Rayon. The fabric is a tan checkered pattern, which looks especially nice with the pleats in the front. The care for this skirt is washer and tumble dry on low. The skirt measures 22 _ inches in length. At the top of the waste band on the left side is a button to secure the skirt (this is in addition to the fashionable safety pin). If you like this item, please check out my other auctions!!! PAYMENT: Credit Cards and E-Personal Checks are accepted via Billpoint; money orders and cashiers checks are also accepted.

Here is a BEAUTIFUL one piece outfit made by Creme de Le Creme in a size 9 months. This is just a simple white quilted look with pockets in the front that are accente with red and a bow. So simple but yet so pretty! This has snaps in the back and I think a more of a crop pant style in the pants leg, not quite all the way to the feet. Along with this outfit I am throwing in a onesie that says "Santa is like Grandpa..they both need their milk &amp; cookies at nite!". The outfit could be worn year around, not only for the holiday season! Created by eBay Seller's Assistant Basic.</Description>

    <Description>Black Broadtail Full Length Coat _ Elegant Black Broadtail Lamb! Description: Up for auction, I have a fabulous RARE full length, black, genuine Broadtail, fur coat. The label reads ARNOLD CONSTABLE - FIFTH AVENUE. I have seen this fur (correctly or incorrectly) sold on Ebay as Persian Lamb, Caracul, Curly Lamb, Krimmer, astrakhan, and Swakara, however, the correct name is 'Broadtail'. A little history on Broadtail,...It is the black pelt of a Karakul sheep that was born too soon and is therefor often referred to as unborn lamb. Broadtail is actually a more prized, and a lot harder to come by, fur than the other lambs. In the market, it is the most expensive of the Karakul pelts. It has a flat (lower nap) silky velvet-like surface and a wavy rippled ( moir_ velvet-like ) a ppearance. Most Broadtail skins are produced in central and southwestern Asia, southwestern Africa, India, and southeastern Europe. A few are produced in Texas. A full length Broadtail coat truly is a rare find. Generally, Broadtail is only seen in the shorter, mink cuffed, mink collar ed jacket style your grandmother so proudly wore to the theater. If this coat fit me, you would not be seeing it on listed on EBay. The style of the coat is very current. The sleeves are a regular full length ( not 3/4 ) and are fashioned with windbreakers - the inside lining is elasticized at the bottom - to keep the wind out and you snug. A great feature! The center front has a hook and loop closure. There are 2 velvet lined pockets on either side that look like they've never had anything in them. The quality of the pelts is comparable to my Schiaparelli s. The fur is in excellent, soft, shiny, condition and the skins are supple. There is no drying or shedding. The lining is made out of a black jacquard fabric - feels and looks like silk but I'm not 100% sure it is - and is in pristine condition. The former owner's name - Hilda - is embroidered into the lining. This coat can be dressed up or down! Wear it..... ....On the weekend over a pair of black Banana Republic jeans, a thick fitted camel cabled cashmere turtleneck sweater, and black leather ankle shoe boots. ....To work (over the holiday season), with a long black suede skirt and a fitted red ribbed cashmere turtleneck. ....To dinner over slate charcoal grey velvet pants, a cashmere twinset, and a string of gray baroque pearls.....So Grace Kelly - ish. Dress it up with a black Mongolian Lamb boa, a dyed fox boa, or a black mink collar as I have in the 5th pic. If you haven't owned a Broadtail coat yet, now is the time. They are as warm as Shearling. When the temperature dips and the wind kicks up, there is nothing that will keep you as toasty warm as one of these fur coats. The condition is excellent. There are no strange odors. The only 'issues' I can find are that 3 of the loops at the center front closure are missing. They are a standard type of fur loop so you will easily find a replacement at a fabric / sewing supplies store or from a furrier. There is also a 1 inch area at the underarm seam that needs restitching. If I am able to get to it, I will have my seamstress take care of this before I ship but because of the time of year it is, I cant promise. ***Sorry, the Russian sable mink collar displayed with the coat is not included in this auction. If you like the look though, scope out Ebay for one. There always seem to be some up for auction. This coat will be shipped to you from my smoke free home. Measuremen ts: All measurements are approximate. There is no size tag in this jacket. I would put it at a Large (L, 10, 12) though that because of the style could also fit a Medium ( 8 ) or XL ( 14 ) depending on how you like your outerwear to fit. Please go by the measurements though. All measurements taken on the outside of the coat. Center back neckline seam to hem = 43 inches long - not including the collar Shoulder to shoulder = 16 inches - measured across the top Bust = 43 inches around - measured on the outside of the coat Sweep (Bottom edge with coat buttoned) = 62 inches around Sleeve length = 24 inches - shoulder seam to sleeve edge uncuffed / 21 1/4 inches with cuff fully rolled back. _ _ Please check my M E page, before bidding, for all the terms and conditions of this auction. ..... HERE to view PICS of my other auctions!..... Thank You for Shopping with Me. Good Luck and Happy EBuying!!! ObayB</Description>

    <Description>CHING DYNASTY POTTERY SHARD PENDANT AND CHAIN Makes a great gift for Any Occasion Description I think this pendant is absolutely fantastic!!! This quite unique pendant features a pottery shard unearthed from an ancient Chinese pottery factory, and its framed in silver plate. These date to at least the Ching Dynasty and perhaps to the Ming Dynasty. The Ching Dynasty was a Manchu Dynasty and was the last Imperial dynasty. Potentially 600-900 years old!!! Fantastic unique and rare jewelry item in this!! Perfect to add to your own collection or a gift for that "hard to buy for" friend or relative. If you like different, unique, eclectic, or Asian arts and antiques - then this one is perfect!! I'm including a silver plated diamond cut rope chain with this to make it ready to go!! Bright silver chain with spring ring clasp. AND, I WILL GIVE YOU YOUR CHOICE OF EITHER AN 18 INCH OR 24 INCH CHAIN. Each of these is one-of-a-kind and unique. All are lovely - just let me choose one for you. I could envision this sold in a jewelry store, upscale clothing and jewelry boutique, or antiques shop or show at at least $29.95 or higher!! As a little note, I do see these listed on Ebay at a much higher price and without a chain. I use Andale Auction Management and prefer payment with Paypal. Payment should be made within 10 days of the close of auction. Prompt shipping upon payment. COMBINED SHIPPNG. BUY ONE OR 10 AT THIS GREAT PRICE FOR ONE LOW SHIPPING CHARGE. Unfortunately I must now add: I'm not responsible once I ship your purchase. I use USPS and have seen some delays in shipping. Please allow for that. For your protection, you might want to get insurance which is $1.10. Priority shipping would be an additional $3.50, signature confirmation is $1.75 (with priority shipping only) _ Details Condition New Payment and Shipping info Payment Options Money Order/Cashier's Check _ _ _ Buyer pays escrow fees Shipping Fixed Shipping Charges.$5.00 (Domestic) $15.00 (International) USPS Parcel Will Ship Internationally Customer Service &amp; Shipping Policy Always fast and prompt shipment.

    <Description>Women's Eddie Bauer Chore Coat Small petite This is a soft three season Eddie Bauer chore coat that was only worn a few times. Snaps or zipper for front closure. Snaps with eddie bauer on them. The shell is a lusciously soft light brown, cotton filled. The pictures show a shine that is not there in real lighting. The liner is a hunter green wool blend. The arm pit to hip measurement is 18" so it works well for small sizes, not just petite. The coat reeks of Eddie Bauer quality and design. andale andalesell Click Images to Enlarge Payment Options: _ Money Order / Cashier's Check , Personal Check Shipping Options: _ Weight based Shipping Charges.

    <Description>This jacket is amazing! It_s made of real leather, including a leather hood that detaches with a zipper. It closes with a zipper in the front, both work perfectly. Men_s size Medium, Women_s size Large. This jacket is so warm and heavy, it_s great for these winter months! It has two pockets on the outside that close by zipper and one open pocket on the inside. The 8-Ball_s on the arms and back are all 10 inches in diameter. For being a few years old, this jacket is in amazing condition. A few very minor, hard to see little blemishes. I took very good care of this jacket! The white parts of the leather show a little dirt but would clean up great with leather cleaner. Colors are black, white and purple. Retails for $350, starting bid of $75 is a steal! Shell: Genuine Leather. Lining: 50% Nylon, 50% Acetate, 100% Nylon. Filler: 100% Polyester Padding. Measurements: From shoulder to wrist _ 23 inches. Underarm to waist _ 11 inches. Shoulder to shoulder _ 25 inches. Neckline to bottom _ 24 inches. Waist _ 35 inches (but can stretch to 47 inches). Waist and wrists have nylon cuff that is stretchy. Kept in a non-smoking environment. ** Be very sure to read the measurements because all sales are FINAL. ** Terms: Buyer pays actual shipping. Insurance is optional but highly recommended. Canada and US only. Payment must be received within 10 days from end of auction. I accept bank or postal money orders, cashier_s checks, or paypal at tahrens@mac. Personal checks accepted only from bidders who have a minimum of 15 positive feedbacks and NO negatives. Positive feedback will be left for those who abide by these terms.

    <Description>This is a very cute pair of flannel jammies in size 6, that would be such a wonderful gift Christmas gift for your little Blues Clues fan! They are an old-fashioned button-up jammy (they remind me of the pajamas English children wear), and due to their color, design and style, in my opinion they would be appropriate for a BOY OR GIRL. They are a soft and cozy 100% polyester flannel and meet all industry safety standards for children's sleepwear. They are royal blue and covered with little sleeping Blue's, and lots of smiling moons. There are also lots of smiley little Pail's and Shovel's and happy crescent moons and stars in yellow. They button up the front with red buttons, and have red ribbed trim at the collar, wrist and leg cuffs, and bottom hem. These pajamas are so fun and sweet, and really comfy---they would be so much fun to snuggle up and wear to bed on winter nights, or to hang around the house and watch Blue's Clues on cold winter mornings! Like all of my items, they are brand new and from a nonsmoking home. Winning bidder pays s/h of 2.75 by first class mail or 4.00 by priority mail, insurance extra if desired. I will ship anywhere in the U.S. Money order, cashier's check or Visa/Mastercard through PayPal only (use link below to join and receive $5.00 signup bonus). PAYPAL PLUS PRIORITY MAIL GUARANTEES SPEEDIEST DELIVERY FOR CHRISTMAS! NO PERSONAL CHECKS. Payment due within 10 days of auction end, DO NOT BID UNLESS YOU ARE A RESPONSIBLE, PROMPT PAYER...NONPAYING BIDDERS WILL BE REPORTED TO EBAY AND APPROPRIATE FEEDBACK WILL BE LEFT. Please visit my other auctions---I will be listing many more clothing and educational items for children this week, including LOTS MORE BLUE'S CLUES GOODIES FOR YOUR LITTLE ONE THIS CHRISTMAS (lots more clothing and pajamas, socks and underwear, toys, room decor, and much more!) and other favorite children's characters and brands. I will happily combine shipping. Courteous and responsible bidders only, please. Thanks so much and God Bless!</Description>

    <Description>_ _ _ _ _ _ The "Enticer" Corset You will be irresistible in this corset! Your man will not know what hit him when he sees you in this!_ Think Nicole Kidman in "Moulin Rogue" or Lil' Kim, Pink, Mya &amp; Christina in the " Lady Marmalade" video. Corsets are VERY sexy! The fabric is a gorgeous black floral brocade. There are 8 bones all around the corset to help stiffen it. There is a row of hooks &amp; eyes in the front to help you get in and out of the corset. Once you have the corset on, tighten the laces in the back. You are going to be blow away at what you see in the mirror! A instantly CURVY figure. Lots of cleavage, a cinched in waist and a overall hourglass shape! To top it off it is trimmed with beautiful black embroidery._ Material: 100% Polyester. Care: "Hand Wash". Size: 36 BRAND NEW! SHIPPING:__ $3.90 I would be happy to answer any questions you may have about this item. Email me at: Jessica@enchantedlingerie.net Corset sizing info: Unlike other items of clothing, you don't want a corset to "fit". If you have a waist size of 26 inches, you would not want the corset to be 26 inches or you would not be able to cinch your waist in. It is recommended that the corset you order be 2-4 inches smaller than your waistline. With the overbust corsets, cup size is not important. The whole idea is to give your bust a look like you're "bursting at the seams"._ _ Size Bust Waist Hip Front Length Back Length Best for Waists Measuring 32 34 32 25 32 14 12 27-29 inches 36 33 26 34 14 12 1/2 28-30 inches 38 _ I accept Visa and Mastercard through Paypal. Send payment to: jessica@enchantedlingerie.net I also accept eChecks though Paypal. Your check must clear before items are shipped. Money orders &amp; cashiers checks are fine, but NO personal checks._ All items are shipped via US Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation. Insurance is extra. Your order is shipped within 24 hours of receiving your payment (48 if received on Saturday)._ Payment is due 10 days after auction. Thank you!! _ _ _ Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information. Payment Instructions All sales are final. All items are BRAND NEW! Thank you!!</Description>

    <Description>This is a great looking mens brown leather jacket marked a size 46 Long. The zip out lining is missing so I don't know who the maker is.I think it is leather, cleaning is the leather process, and it looks and feels like leather but it does not actually say leather anywhere. It is in very good condition, clean, the leather is not worn or scratched, the zipper works. The lining is a satin and is torn slightly by the sleeve edge. Also a button on the sleeve closing is cracked in half but still works. It measures 24" underarm to underarm, it is 26" from the shoulder to the wrist and it is 26" from the neck seam to the bottom. What a nice all purpose jacket!! There is no reserve. Buyer to pay postage. Money order, paypal or personal check for payment. Thanks for looking!!!</Description>

Please visit our many other auctions BID WITH CONFIDENCE! 2,000+ Positive Feedbacks! If this is your first time bidding with us, please read our FAQ Page. If you cannot comply with the terms of the auction, please do not bid. FAQ HOW CAN YOU SELL SO CHEAP? WHERE DO YOU GET THE STUFF? We specialize in the remarketing of New, Used, and Distressed Merchandise. These items are from overstock warehouses, company liquidations, freight claims, bulk auctions, and insurance purchases. This means that some items may be missing manuals, cords, cables, disks, factory packaging and/or may have light to severe damage. Please read the ENTIRE auction and ask ALL questions prior to bidding. We suggest you call or visit the manufacturer's page for detailed information. Items may have come originally with accessories such as remotes, cables, or batteries. If it's not listed in the description, don't expect it. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "UNTESTED" AND "AS-IS"? Please understand that our warehouse does not have the equipment, facilities, or time to fully test every item. We offer a "cursory" inspection on all items and list our findings in the auction description. We supply all available Make/Model information for you to review and research. Please do your own research prior to bidding. All items and contents are described to the best of our ability. Unless the auction description states differently, these items are sold and "as-is". We reserve the right to refuse sale or service for any reason. WHEN SHOULD I SEND PAYMENT? Payment is due within 10 days of the closing of the auction. Otherwise, we reserve the right to re-post or re-sell this item and request credit from eBay, at our discretion. Acceptable forms of payment include Cashier Checks, Money Orders, and Bank Wire Transfers. If necessary, we can accept personal or company checks. We normally ship within 3-5 business days for certified funds. We hold all checks for 7-10 working days for validation. We do not use I-Escrow or any other escrow company. Other payment terms may be available and will be disclosed in our "Payment Email" that will be sent to you at the end of the auction. Unless otherwise stated, Sales are final. All others we offer a 50% restocking fee for any returns, less shipping and paypal fees (if applicable). I WON MORE THAN ONE ITEM OR I AM BIDDING ON MORE OF YOUR AUCTIONS. SHOULD I WAIT AND SEND PAYMENTS ALL AT ONCE? I MAY SAVE A BUCK OR TWO? Although we appreciate you bidding on more of our items, it would be more efficient if you sent in each payment as the item closes. We use an automated system and it sends out confirmations, feedbacks, Non-Pay Bidder Reminders, and other eBay related operations automatically. That's why it's so important to get payment in within 10 days of the close of the auction and keep auctions as separate transactions. If you delay, you may get warnings from eBay or you may actually lose your item because it got re-posted. We also do not combine shipping fees because we ship from various warehouses and cannot guarantee that items will be shipped together. Also, it requires us to manually do each multiple order and that interferes with our automated system. Therfore, we do not combine shipping fees. If you get multiple items shipped together, it's just a matter of luck and chance. HOW DO YOU SHIP WITH AND WHAT IF I'M OUTSIDE YOUR STANDARD SHIPPING AREA? We ship via UPS Ground from Connecticut, 06804. For books, videos, CDs video games and other media we may offer Media Mail Rates. If available, it would be listed in the auction description. We cannot ship to PO BOXES or Military APO addresses. If you are outside the 48 contiguous US states, shipping fees are more. Please contact us for the estimated rates prior to bidding. PAYPAL USERS: We can ONLY ship to verified Paypal addresses. If you want it shipped to a different address send your payment via the mail. Whenever possible, we will provide shipping weights and/or fixed shipping costs. Fixed shipping rates are for shipping within the 48 contiguous states. If you are outside of this area, contact us prior to bidding. Shipping will be higher. Sorry, we do not combine shipping fees. It screws up our automated accounting and shipping programs. HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN YOU RECEIVE MY PAYMENT OR WHEN MY ITEM IS SHIPPED? We issue the buyer a Positive Feedback the day your payment is received and entered. You can use this as a reference of when your item will be shipped. If you provide us an email, we will email you a tracking number. All shipping questions should be directed to shipping@highendequipment.com. We are no longer responsible for items once it is picked up by the courier. If damage occurs during transit, we will assist in the claims process. No product refunds will be issued until the claim is paid. Shipping fees are not refundable for any reason. ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE I BID? Please read all the information on the auction and do your research prior to bidding. If you have any questions, please call our office at 203-740-9111 or email us at inquiry@highendequipment.com. By placing a bid on this auction you are confirming that you have read all the information, asked all your questions, and understand the terms of this auction. NICE FEEDBACK RATING, BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY NEGATIVES? The fact of the matter is, we are only human. We do make mistakes. We also use automated systems and internet based platforms to help automate the selling process. We can fix our human errors, unfortunately the others are not as easy. We can't fix external programs like eBay or AuctionWatch. Most problems can be resolved with one phone call. We try our best to service all customers and when we make a mistake, we take care of it. Not every buyer gives us the opportunity to correct for our mistakes. Most of our negatives are from new users who don't understand or respect the rules of eBay. They don't read the auctions and are not very good shoppers. If a problem comes up, they SLAM a Negative Feedback and not even give us a chance to address the issue. Basically, when we are given the opportunity, we take care of everybody. Hey, you can't be an eBay PowerSeller without doing something right! MAN, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS RETURN EMAILS FASTER? Everyone in our company travels frequently to find the best deals to bring to you on eBay. Therefore, it is difficult for us to return emails in a timely manner. If all else fails, call our office for assistance. 203-740-9111. Office hours are Mon-Fri 9am-5pm EST. We strive to bring you the best items at the very best prices possible!

    <Description>This is a BRAND NEW container of Burt's Bees Carrot Seed oil Complexion Mist for mature and sun aged/damaged skin. The purpose of this is to hydrate and soothe mature and sun-aged skin. It is a great refresher. It is 100% natural. Carrot seed oil stimulates cell renewal and sebaceous glands, a great benefit to mature or dry skin. This also is great in making a light weight moisturizer by mixing mist with any of the skin cremes. I mix it with the carrot lotion for my moisturizer. You can even mist over make-up. Any time you are feeling dehydrated drink some water and spray the mist on your face. A great refresher for airplane travels. This item retails for $7. Don't hesitate to email me with any questions. I carry the full Burt's Bees line of products and I'm hooked on it as well as trained on the products. Be sure to check out my other auctions. Virginia residents add 4.5% tax.

Please visit our many other auctions BID WITH CONFIDENCE! 2,000+ Positive Feedbacks! If this is your first time bidding with us, please read our FAQ Page. If you cannot comply with the terms of the auction, please do not bid. FAQ HOW CAN YOU SELL SO CHEAP? WHERE DO YOU GET THE STUFF? We specialize in the remarketing of New, Used, and Distressed Merchandise. These items are from overstock warehouses, company liquidations, freight claims, bulk auctions, and insurance purchases. This means that some items may be missing manuals, cords, cables, disks, factory packaging and/or may have light to severe damage. Please read the ENTIRE auction and ask ALL questions prior to bidding. We suggest you call or visit the manufacturer's page for detailed information. Items may have come originally with accessories such as remotes, cables, or batteries. If it's not listed in the description, don't expect it. WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY "UNTESTED" AND "AS-IS"? Please understand that our warehouse does not have the equipment, facilities, or time to fully test every item. We offer a "cursory" inspection on all items and list our findings in the auction description. We supply all available Make/Model information for you to review and research. Please do your own research prior to bidding. All items and contents are described to the best of our ability. Unless the auction description states differently, these items are sold and "as-is". We reserve the right to refuse sale or service for any reason. WHEN SHOULD I SEND PAYMENT? Payment is due within 10 days of the closing of the auction. Otherwise, we reserve the right to re-post or re-sell this item and request credit from eBay, at our discretion. Acceptable forms of payment include Cashier Checks, Money Orders, and Bank Wire Transfers. If necessary, we can accept personal or company checks. We normally ship within 3-5 business days for certified funds. We hold all checks for 7-10 working days for validation. We do not use I-Escrow or any other escrow company. Other payment terms may be available and will be disclosed in our "Payment Email" that will be sent to you at the end of the auction. Unless otherwise stated, Sales are final. All others we offer a 50% restocking fee for any returns, less shipping and paypal fees (if applicable). I WON MORE THAN ONE ITEM OR I AM BIDDING ON MORE OF YOUR AUCTIONS. SHOULD I WAIT AND SEND PAYMENTS ALL AT ONCE? I MAY SAVE A BUCK OR TWO? Although we appreciate you bidding on more of our items, it would be more efficient if you sent in each payment as the item closes. We use an automated system and it sends out confirmations, feedbacks, Non-Pay Bidder Reminders, and other eBay related operations automatically. That's why it's so important to get payment in within 10 days of the close of the auction and keep auctions as separate transactions. If you delay, you may get warnings from eBay or you may actually lose your item because it got re-posted. We also do not combine shipping fees because we ship from various warehouses and cannot guarantee that items will be shipped together. Also, it requires us to manually do each multiple order and that interferes with our automated system. Therfore, we do not combine shipping fees. If you get multiple items shipped together, it's just a matter of luck and chance. HOW DO YOU SHIP WITH AND WHAT IF I'M OUTSIDE YOUR STANDARD SHIPPING AREA? We ship via UPS Ground from Connecticut, 06804. For books, videos, CDs video games and other media we may offer Media Mail Rates. If available, it would be listed in the auction description. We cannot ship to PO BOXES or Military APO addresses. If you are outside the 48 contiguous US states, shipping fees are more. Please contact us for the estimated rates prior to bidding. PAYPAL USERS: We can ONLY ship to verified Paypal addresses. If you want it shipped to a different address send your payment via the mail. Whenever possible, we will provide shipping weights and/or fixed shipping costs. Fixed shipping rates are for shipping within the 48 contiguous states. If you are outside of this area, contact us prior to bidding. Shipping will be higher. Sorry, we do not combine shipping fees. It screws up our automated accounting and shipping programs. HOW WILL I KNOW WHEN YOU RECEIVE MY PAYMENT OR WHEN MY ITEM IS SHIPPED? We issue the buyer a Positive Feedback the day your payment is received and entered. You can use this as a reference of when your item will be shipped. If you provide us an email, we will email you a tracking number. All shipping questions should be directed to shipping@highendequipment.com. We are no longer responsible for items once it is picked up by the courier. If damage occurs during transit, we will assist in the claims process. No product refunds will be issued until the claim is paid. Shipping fees are not refundable for any reason. ANYTHING ELSE BEFORE I BID? Please read all the information on the auction and do your research prior to bidding. If you have any questions, please call our office at 203-740-9111 or email us at inquiry@highendequipment.com. By placing a bid on this auction you are confirming that you have read all the information, asked all your questions, and understand the terms of this auction. NICE FEEDBACK RATING, BUT WHY DO YOU HAVE SO MANY NEGATIVES? The fact of the matter is, we are only human. We do make mistakes. We also use automated systems and internet based platforms to help automate the selling process. We can fix our human errors, unfortunately the others are not as easy. We can't fix external programs like eBay or AuctionWatch. Most problems can be resolved with one phone call. We try our best to service all customers and when we make a mistake, we take care of it. Not every buyer gives us the opportunity to correct for our mistakes. Most of our negatives are from new users who don't understand or respect the rules of eBay. They don't read the auctions and are not very good shoppers. If a problem comes up, they SLAM a Negative Feedback and not even give us a chance to address the issue. Basically, when we are given the opportunity, we take care of everybody. Hey, you can't be an eBay PowerSeller without doing something right! MAN, WHY DON'T YOU GUYS RETURN EMAILS FASTER? Everyone in our company travels frequently to find the best deals to bring to you on eBay. Therefore, it is difficult for us to return emails in a timely manner. If all else fails, call our office for assistance. 203-740-9111. Office hours are Mon-Fri 9am-5pm EST. We strive to bring you the best items at the very best prices possible!

We would like to show our Christmas spirit as well as our gratitude to all of our wonderful Ebay customers for the holidays.

This is good for all auctions that are marked "Christmas Special". You can only use this special with one transaction at a time. Example: If you purchase 4 items and wish to have them all shipped together you can only use the special for 2 items and will be charged the winning bid amount plus $1 s&amp;h for the additional two items.

You can use the special on the first two items and pay $5.50 for s&amp;h, and then use the special for the second two items and pay $5.50 for s&amp;h. In some instances this would not work out as well for you as using the combined shipping option. We wish everyone the VERY Merriest Christmas And Happy New Year!!

    <Description>These are a great pair of Dan Post bullhide, pointed toe, cowboy boots in size 8D. My boyfriend wears a 9D but these very comfortable boots have just formed to fit his feet perfectly! The length is 11" and the sole measures at 4". The point of the right boot is scuffed just a bit along with both heels, but again, only as much as to be expected. The 2" heel caps are in good condition with a lot of life still left in them. The soles show normal wear but overall are also in good condition. Please bid with complete confidence and see my perfect feedback. PayPal or Billpoint preferred. Buyer to pay $7 UPS/insurance shipping costs. Thank you for stopping by.</Description>

    <Description>This is a really stunning dress that has the elegance to grace any formal affair. It would make a lovely "mother of the bride" dress. Made by B.G.B., in a size 18, of 60% acetate 40% rayon (but it does NOT wrinkle like rayon!). It is very roomy &amp; very figure flattering. 6 buttons in a navy/white polka dot run down the back. The dress ties at the back with this same polka dot fabric. The rest of the dress is in an identical fabric but with tiny wildflowers instead. The sleeves are softly gathered at the shoulders (fabric covered shoulder pads) and fall to just below the elbows. A scoop neck, loose bodice ending below waist in 1" pleats all around. A very elegant dress that will suit a wedding, but also refined enough to wear to the office. Excellent condition. Original price was $160.00. Measurements: bust 50". Length: 50 1/2". Non smoking home. Shipping is $9. Money orders only, please. Payment due 10 days after auction. Click on a picture to enlarge ') //-- ') //-- Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

I am getting rid of these because my son has gotten so many clothes as gifts and hand-me-downs, etc. that we have way too many. All items come from a pet-free, smoke-free home. I accept Paypal (existing funds or bank transfers only), money order, or cashiers check. Buyer will pay actual shipping costs, determined by zip code and shipping preferences. (Handling charges will only apply if special packaging is required and extra supplies are needed.) Also, check out my additional auctions to save on shipping. Please feel free to contact me with any questions. Thank you for looking and have a great day! God bless! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>98 HOT WHEELS MATTEL 50th Anniversary McDonal This 1998 Hot Wheels 50th Anniversary McDonald's vehicle is bright bronze in color with very dark slanted windows. On the hood are the words "NasCar 50th Anniversary" along with the golden arches of the McDonald's logo. Measuring 3 inches in length, the number "94" is painted on the roof of the cab in yellow letters outlined in light blue. Wording on the bottom says "1998 Mattel Inc., Hot Wheels, Mfg for McD Corp., China CB Chine". There are a couple of of small scratches on this sporty vehicle; nonetheless, it would surely delight a young child's heart to find this in his or her stocking on Christmas.
