    <Description>Up for auction is a maroon and off white "Universal" brand mixer. This mixer is unique in that their are 10 settings as follows:adding(ingredients,stirring);mashing(vegetables,potatoes);blending(heavy batters);creaming(vegetables,potatoes);mixing(light batter,blending);whipping(mayonaise,dressing);creaming(sugar,butter);beating(egg whites,whip cream);beating(icings,candy); and juicing(fruits,attachments).This mixer can also detach from base to use hand held.It was made by Landers, Frary and Clark,New Britain, CT.This is a very well made mixer and quite alot of power.The color is a maroon handle which I think is very unique in color and the base to be off white.There is only very,very slight pitting on the base (that you could touch up with paint)where the bowl sits that would not be noticable if a bowl were sitting on it. Unfortunately there are no bowls but I have tried Glasbake and other bowls universal to other mixers and they have worked.If you are into "quality" then this mixer is for you.If you have any question please e-mail me.Thank you for l@@king!!Happy Holidays!

BOX OF OVER 125 DC COMICS! In this box you'll get over 125 DC comics. They are some known titles thrown in (Flash,Green Lantern), about 20%. Their conditions range from good to near mint, but nothing totally trashed. We've even thrown in a couple of nice ones to sweeten the pot, like Black Orchid &amp; Aquaman. Their ages range across three decades from the early '70's to mid-'90's. Not a bad deal! S&amp;H will be determined after the auction and determined by shipping zip code. Please see shipping costs/methods and insurance requirements below. For larger items please click here to email us for a quote. All breakables and items valued near and above $50 will have insurance required. If the item is shipped via FedEx this coverage is automatic up to $100 in value, 40_ for each additional $100 coverage. For USPS delivery, $1.25 up to $50, $1.00 each additional $100. All uninsured parcels become the responsiblity of the bidder once said parcel is duly delivered to the appropriate carrier. The following types of payment are accepted: money orders, personal checks*, and all major credit cards. Payment must be received within 10 business days in order to avoid negative feedback and being reported to eBay as a non-payer. This will also expedite shipping of your item. * All returned checks will be accessed a $25 service fee. Click here to view my other auctions. Ma residents pay a 5% sales tax. SHIPPING METHODS: The bidder may at any time request the shipping service of their choice, to which will be added an appropriate handling fee. MEDIA: We have been shipping media items (records, books, etc.) by Media mail, but have experienced slow delivery times, so we are trying to move away from this service. Smaller, light-weight media items over 13 ozs. are still quoted for Media mail and the bidder may request a different delivery service. However, we WILL NOT be held responsible for the long amount of time any Media mail shipment may take. SMALLER ITEMS: Other smaller items up to 13 ozs. are shipped first class. All other items are shipped either Priority mail or FedEx. Usually anything over a few pounds is shipped via FedEx, hence the higher costs. However, their exemplary service is guarenteed, carries automatic insurance up to $100 in value, and is trackable with out additional cost. Any item shipped through the USPS Priority service without requesting additional services such as delivery confirmation can not be tracked, nor will we be held responsibility for its not being delivered (see insurance disclaimer above). LARGER ITEMS: Larger items such as furniture and such are shipped either with BAX Global or a local mover we use who makes east coast runs every two-three weeks. HANDLING FEES: Since our shipping department needs to eat (and we require him to wear shoes, please! ), and shipping materials do cost money (really!) all items have an appropriate handling fee. Basically, the more time and care taken to prepare an item for safe transport, the higher the fee. We do our best to provide both cost effective and careful handling of packaging your item. This fee is not negotiable is usually reflected in all posted S&amp;H charges, or added to shipping quotes for larger items.

I built up a 550+ feedback rating while working with Socko! Comics. Now I am starting over on my own, but that means starting with a feedback of zero. Read my Honesty Policy below. 1966 VF DC TEEN TITANS #1 - 4 QUESTIONS: click here to send an e-mail CONDITION : NEAR MINT OPENING BID: $9.99 HOW TO PAY? MONEY ORDER &amp; PAYPAL HOW TO SHIP? I ship via United States Postal Service for both domestic and international. You pay only the cost required to ship. I do not believe in padding auctions by adding unjustified extra charges. I don't like it when people do it to me, so I won't do it to you. PICTURES: Click on each to get a larger view. _ #1 Front #1 Back #3 Front #3 Back #4 Front #4 Back HONESTY POLICY I have met people in my store who won books on E-Bay that were nowhere near the condition described. It angers me as a seller because it ruins the reputations of dealers as a whole. Simply put, it hurts our market by driving away customers. How Do I Grade? I look at every book and grade it according to six categories: front cover, back cover, corners, edges, spine &amp; staples, interior pages. I give a complete description of each of these sections noting any flaws or defects. Also, I include large scans of the front and back covers. When I have completed the auction page, I am satisfied that you know exactly what you are bidding on and that there will be no surprises at auction's end. So what about returns? At first I offered returns on books. Then I quickly discovered that some people would outbid everyone else by an excessively high amount just to get a look at the book, then ask for a return if they decided they didn't want it. I no longer offer returns. I am confident in my grading and description and have never had a complaint about either. If you are not sure that you want the book then don't bid on it. COMPLETE DESCRIPTION: _ All books have come fromt he same collection and have received the same tender care over the years. Title: Teen Titans Issue(s) &amp; Date(s): #1 - Jan/Feb 1966 - F+ (spine creases, minor corner wear, discoloration along right side &amp; spine edges) #3 - May/Jun 1966- VF (spine creases, minor corner wear) #4 - Jul/Aug 1966 - VF (minor spine creases) Issue #1 features appearances by Batman, Flash, Aquaman &amp; Wonder Woman.

    <Description>Produced in the early 1990's by D.C. Comics, this was a very limited premium that was not available for direct purchase. The only way to acquire it was by retailers through the purchase of large quantities of a Wonder Woman book from D.C. Comics. Retailers then chose whether to make them available to their customers. We acquired these at that time from D.C. and are now making them available for the first time. It is a 1 1/16" diameter cloisonne pin, in mint condition and has never been used. It features the famous WW logo as seen on the chest of Wonder Womanb's costume. Check our other auctions for more great merchandise, including additional pins and comic related merchandise.

    <Description>LEGIONNAIRES 1-6, 9, 13 SUPERMAN PLUS THE LEGION OF SUPER-HEROES #1 9 Books! When Keith Giffen revamped the dying Legion of Super-Heroes title by aging the characters and ditching those funny looking colorful leotards...he hit an audience that was ready for some sophisticated, yet humorous storylines. But there were a great deal of people who missed the young innocence that the title used to have. So how do you appease both sets of fans? Simple, you have an evil alien race, the Dominion, clone the Legionnaires and incubate them for use as weapons in their plans to invade Earth. But the Legion of Substitute Heroes liberates the clones (who conveniently have incubated to the age they were when they first met Superboy) and both sets of Legionnaires band together to defeat the Dominion. But what do you do now, with two sets of most of your favorite Legionnaires? Again, simple...you give the young clones their own title. Written by Tom &amp; Mary Bierbaum and drawn by Chris Sprouse. I am not a professional grader, so the best way to describe the books are that they're readers copies in pretty decent shape. And don't go knocking the value of a readers copy book. Let's say you're not a collector but you missed the comics of yesteryear, when comics really meant something, and you'd like to relive a little of that magic without having to spend a fortune. Readers copies are the way to go. Now, let's say you are a collector and go through the meticulous process of keeping your comics preserved. If you ever get nostalgic and decide to crack open one of those mylar bags (or whatever protection you use), you run the risk of damaging your precious books. Readers copies allow you to read without fear. Readers Copies. An inexpensive way to explore the valuable history of comics. All proceeds from this auction will be applied to the funding of my film project. Proceeds go to help fund my film, so bids are welcome and appreciated. Thanks for helping make my dream a reality. METHOD OF PAYMENT Postal Money Order or Cashier's Check only, please. SHIPPING $3.90. Everything is shipped Priority Mail, Delivery Confirmation (for my protection as well as yours.

    <Description>LOOK AT THIS DEAL! IF YOU COLLECT EAGLES AND/OR KEYCHAINS, OR KNOW SOMEONE ELSE WHO DOES, THIS IS FOR YOU! You are bidding on a mint in package keychain, beautiful gold colored metal, of a majestic eagle . It's gorgeous. NOTE: I am showing 4 keychains in this auction; you are bidding ONLY on the eagle shown on far left in bottom photo. Other keychains are listed, as well as many more items, in other auctions of mine, so please check 'em out! The keychain ring itself measures 1 inch in diameter. The stylized sculpture, from top to bottom, measures 1_ inches high and 1_ inches wide. What a wonderful addition to your own keychain collection or as a very nice gift for another special someone (put a couple away for gifts later!)! What a find!! I am showing some keychains in silver and others in gold so you can see the difference, and I will also be selling the same keychain in the silver metal version, but in THIS auction, you are bidding on the eagle, in gold . Don't pass this up!! Any birthdays coming up? Or stash it away for that perfect last-minute gift idea!! NO RESERVE! NOTE: ALL OF MY ITEMS COME FROM A SMOKE-FREE ENVIRONMENT!! Buyer pays $1.25 for regular uninsured first class shipping/handling (in padded envelope) (Non-U.S. buyers pay extra shipping/postage, determined by location). BONUS! If you win 3 or more of these keychains (gold and/or silver), I will pay regular shipping on this item to anywhere in the continental United States! If you win more than one of my auctions, I will combine to save you money on shipping. I DO reserve the right to refuse bids from those with unfavorable or private feedback. NOTE: due to the continued problems with bad checks, I shall no longer accept any personal or business checks . Payment must be made by Paypal, cashier's check, money order or cash ( If you are non-US bidder, I accept cash or international money orders - the money orders must ONLY be POSTAL money orders! ) If you send me a check, it will only delay shipment as I shall void your check then have to wait for another form of payment, which must be received within 3 days. Voided check will be returned with shipped item. Please note that i DO leave negative feedback for non-payment and/or non-response to high bid notification after second notice. I realize that most bidders are honest and reliable, but I hope you can understand it from my side and having to pay my own bank costs, etc. Thanks for understanding . See my other auctions, too!! I now accept PayPal for auction payments. Please feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions!</Description>

    <Description>Photo Click Image for Larger Preview Description PREVIOUSLY VIEWED SEALED VHS John Woo raises the action bar in this violent, romantic sequel to Brian De Palma's 1996 original. Tom Cruise is back as Ethan Hunt, this time battling wits with rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott). Hunt is ordered to recruit Ambrose's former lover, Nyah Hall (Thandie Newton), to infiltrate his hideout. But Hunt never expected to fall for the lovely young thief he must use for bait. The romantic triangle that ensues gives the film a unique emotional balance that is unusual (and most welcome) for an action picture. Ambrose is after the killer Chimera virus and its antidote, Bellerophon; in the old days Ambrose would have been after world domination, but in this new world order of day trading and Internet stocks, all he wants is to corner the market and make a fortune. This movie is pre-viewed and is in original box. The movie is Sealed, Shrink-wrapped and Guaranteed working. 100% in excellent condition. Shipping &amp; Payment All payAments must be received by me in 10 days or less. Please only bid if you intend to buy. Buyer is to pay shipping and insurance . Also I pack my items very well and professionally Payment Options: I accept the following forms of payment: PayPal, Money Order, cashiers check.

The plate is number 4268A and it was produced by the Hamilton Collection. The firing date was 4-20-83 and the firing master was R.T. Condition is excellent, when I opened the original box, the plate was still in a plastic bag. The box is water damaged, but the plate is mint. Terms &amp; Conditions S/H/I in the U.S. for this item is $7. This includes USPS and Insurance up to $100. International shipping is more. I base this on the cost of the box, bubbles and tape, plus a guess at the weight of the item, I_m not getting rich on shipping fees! Payment by Billpoint, check or money order is due within 10 days. I may hold personal checks for as much as 10 days. I ship on Tuesdays and Fridays. All sales are final, unless I have failed to include significant information about the piece.

    <Description>Marble Sesquicentennial Liberty Bell Souvenir BIDDERS-NO NEED TO USE CHECKOUT-I WILL EMAIL THE WINNER DIRECTLY. This is a neat, marble/stone &amp; metal, what I believe to be, paper weight ? from the Sesquicentennial celebration. I'm not sure what the metal is, but a magnet will not stick to it. It measures 5-1/4" high x 3/4" a the top and tapering down to 2" at the bottom. The original felt is still intact. Shows some light scratches on the back and one teenie (1/8") chip on the top back edge. The front reads: THE SESQUICENTENNIAL PHILADELPHIA 1776-1926. A nice addition to any collection. Please email with any questions. NO RESERVE! Buyer to pay shipping/handling and insurance if desired. Please allow time for personal check to clear or send m.o. for quick shipping.

    <Description>This is a Harbour Lights collectible from the Signature series. It depicts the lighthouse at Thomas Point, MD, #421. It is in perfect condition and in the box with all of the certificates. There is, however, a small tear in the tag on the bottom which carries the signature. The signature is in no way defaced though. Still has the retail tag of $90 on it. My reserve is much below that. Please pay by cashier's check or money order and include $6 for shipping and insurance. Thanks. Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>Offered for auction is this NEVER USED, PAMPERED CHEF gourmet ice shaver/snow cone machine, which comes complete with all 3 freezing tubs and lids. I purchased this at a Pampered Chef party a while back, but never got around to using it. When I moved, it never got unpacked and I forgot about it. So, it has never been used and is just like new! I must have thrown the original box away however, or else misplaced it as I can't locate it anywhere. This particular Pampered Chef utensil/gadget was demonstrated at the party and it so impressed me that I purchased one. If you like cool treats, have kiddos that do, or want to concoct your own fruity, healthy gourmet treats, this is the gadget for you! You can mix-up your sorbets or potions in advance and freeze them in the included tubs, then simply pull them from the freezer and you are ready to finely shave your frozen concoctions! A great treat for all! Pay just a fraction of the original cost! Winning bidder to pay the actual USPS Priority Mail shipping charge of $5.15. Optional postal insurance is additional if desired. We accept PayPal, money order and personal check payments. Thank you for your interest in this great Pampered Chef gourmet kitchen gadget.

    <Description>EASY CARD TO WALLET PLUS GAFF VARIETY PACKET! EASY CARD TO WALLET Here is a great easy to perform "Card to Wallet" routine. I have personally been using this method for over 4 years with much success! There are many ways to get a spectator's signed card to a wallet. Most of the routines for this effect involve palming a card in some way. The beauty of this routine is that although palming is not needed, the end result appears the same to the spectator. This routine is so easy; you may actually feel guilty when you use it! You will blow your audiences away with this very strong routine. GAFF VARIETY PACKET! How many times have you needed a certain gaffed card for an effect and didn't have it? Sometimes it's even hard to locate certain gaffed cards. When you finally locate the gaffed cards, they usually cost upwards of fifty cents apiece or more! Well, you're in luck. I've done the footwork, and taken the hassle out of locating the most needed gaffed cards! All these gaffed cards are poker sized "Bicycle" stock. You will get 3 cards of each gaff. You get a total of 21 gaffed cards! Here is what you get In my variety pack: 3-Double backed red cards. 3-Double backed blue cards. 3-Two color double-backed cards (1 side red &amp; 1 side blue). 3-Double blank face cards. 3-Double face cards. 3-Blank face red back cards. 3-Blank face blue back cards Don't pass up this great offer. I don't think you can get a variety pack like this without actually investing in at least one deck of each gaff. You will eventually need these cards for something you will want to work on. When you do_you will have them! This variety pack will cost much, much less than you would pay in stores. I hope you can appreciate the value offered here! Auction must be paid within 10 days of close of auction or buyer forfeits auction and negative feedback will be left. I believe in speedy transactions, Serious buyers only please. For all my great customers, thanks so much for your continued business! Buyer pays $2.40 shipping. "PAY PAL" is always welcomed!

    <Description>AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #205 NM- BLACK CAT Most of the Spidey's I'm listing from 160 up came from a collection that look like the comics were never read &amp; immediately placed in plastic bags. They have just the slightest imperfections and bone white back covers. I sent about six of them to CGC &amp; they came back between 9.2-9.6. With the cost to slab a comic I can't take a chance on sending these in &amp; coming back a 9.2 or 9.4. I can only recover my cost if they grade a 9.6 or better. Get some really nice high grade Spidey's without the CGC cost added in. Check out my return policy! If you hate being out bid at the last second, or try to win several low dollar auctions from a seller to save on shipping but only win one, then you need to check out my large run of "Buy it now" Spider-Man auctions. This is a great chance to get what you want right now without waiting until auction closes. Good luck! Hi, I'm Leroy Harper. I've been selling comics over 17 years. On all comics that I grade I refund purchase price plus round trip s/h cost if not satisfied for domestic orders. On international orders I refund purchase price and return s/h cost! How many ebay sellers offer that? I'm an eBay Powerseller with zero negative feedback so bid with confidence. Your complete satisfaction is my number one goal, I strive to make all ebay transactions a pleasant experience. Satisfaction guaranteed or money promptly refunded. *Strict accurate grading. *Checks or M.O. accepted, checks must clear before order sent (usually 10 business days) M.O. sent next day. *Now accepting Pay Pal lets you pay by Visa or M.C., click on link to find out more. *Buyer pays shipping. *Orders shipped Priority U.S. mail. *Shipping and handling for domestic are as follows, 1-2 comics $4.50, 3-9 comics $5.00, 10-15 comics$6.00.

    <Description>Very old ROOT BEER bottle, clean This is a very nice, very old ROOT bottle. My guess is that it's around 10 fluid ounces in capacity. It's a greenish-aqua color, and has no markings around the bottle, except for the word ROOT on the bottom of the bottle. Has some minor bubbling in the glass, which gives it great character. I have no idea whom the manufacturer is, or how old this is. Definitely displays great. The picture shows the "water" look it gave when photographed, and doesn't represent just how clean and colorful this bottle is. NEVER A RESERVE!!! Combine winning lots and save on shipping charges! Item will be sent USPS Priority, and will cost $4.50. Insurance charges will be additional. Buyer assumes all responsibility for package once it is shipped, so insurance is advised. Payment may be made by: money order, cash (at your own risk), personal check, or PayPal. My preferred method of payment is PayPal. All transactions by check must clear my bank before items are shipped (this can take 8-10 business days to clear). Payment by money order, cash (at your own risk), or PayPal will ensure quicker mailing. Please understand that my I do my outgoing package mailing on Saturdays, and package will ship Saturday after payment is received. I reserve the right to cancel the bids of those bidders with negative feedback, or a history of non-payment. Payment is expected within 10 days of notification of winning bid.

On the box lid, a 3rd sea gull is in the background as well as a lighthouse sitting on a rock. The coasters just have the two gulls over water. Thank you for stopping.

It it a beautiful medium brown color with the grapevine/arbor design being in white flocking. Tag reads G&amp;W,grape arbor,all rayon,fast colors,completely washable,stabilized for shrinkage,RN14888, size 52x52 approx. and has washing instructions on the reverse of the tag. There a a total of 4 lines of the grapes design running 1 way across the tablecloth. The 2 outer border designs are wider than the 2 inner. This is really a stunning tablecloth from years ago.

    <Description>Star Trek 1983.Included in this lot are the following issues,all nm/m,warehouse copies,1-3;6-14;16-19;24,27-30;33,37,39,40,47,53,54,55 annual1,2,Whos who in star trek 1,2;Guide value ~96.00 Also Note that this scan generally will overstate defects.Nevertheless bid with confidence! The grades you see are extremely accurate. (Read what the buyer of a $1000.00 AF 15 recently said about our scan"Slightly better than appeared on the scan. A+" -nov 28 2001 feedback, or just to confirm read the Dec 3 2001 feedback of a VF Green Lantern purchase;". Better than described. A+++++ THANKS ";OR read what a buyer of a nm Thor said"Pinpoint grading (an ebay rarity!) Recommend this seller.Dec 3 2001)).All grades are guarenteed within 0.5 of any grading service. The grade quoted above is an accurate grade reflecting the true condition of the book.The price is set so that you will be hard pressed to find as good a deal anywhere else.(This 33% bigger scan( than the books' actual size) magnifies and enlarges defects-it is like looking at the book through a magnification factor). Generally speaking the book possess's a solid intact spine with no splits;staples solidly in place;corners sharp;gloss and color deapth vivid,deep and close to new in appearance;only minor spine stress marks may exist( often similar to thoses produced at original printing);overall a glossy off white to white paged copy offered at an unbeatable initial bid. As we have a large multiple grade inventory of Silver and Golden age books,many will be offered for sale in coming ads.There are many comics being auctioned off on Ebay this week.Combine auctions to save postage.THOUSANDS of other books are still to come including most Marvel and DC titles from 1950 up.Use the BUY IT NOW feature to end the auction and lock out the competition.(Note; on some multiscan auctions we are not able to offer the buy it now feature) We are multiple CBG award winners;EBAY Power sellers;and have 1000 total positive feedbacks(many multiple) since we began here about 2 years ago.Some may remember us for our full page Marvel adds starting in the 1980's.Our Marvel and DC inventory is extensive and often stocked in multiple conditions form the 1950's up...Note.All our scans are "High resolution".That means a magnified, extremley detailed scan which is about 33% LARGER than the actual size of the comic.( so, of course, defects appear about 1/3rd bigger,than if you were viewing the item right in front of you)..Why do we do this?Why do we want the comic to have all the defects OVERSTATED? Here are the reasons; 1)All defects are CLEARLY seen.(in our opinion a small scan is of no use-the grade can be anything). 2) By revealing all defects,you can grade based upon what you like or dislike about a book. 3) No two grades have the same defects,thus a large scan allows you to delineate the key aspects of the book. 4)A large scan will OVERSTATE defects.Defects appear LARGER than what you will see when you get the book.(This applies especially to creases(thicker than actual),and stress marks,and to a lesser extent to color tones,which may show gradations in color not visible with the naked eye).Most of our customers note that the book is nicer when it arrives than what this scan revealed(reasons;the scans bright flood light reveal evey single microscopic impact point,plus defects appear 33% larger.) 5)All our books are guaranteed to be in the same general grade range(within+/- 0.5) if the book is slabbed(within 14 days of purchase) 6) Full exchange privledges on any item purchased.within 7 days. 7) Shipping : Cost; 5.00 for less than 5 comics(priority mail with delivery confirmation) in North America NOTE ;Allow 2 weeks for material to reach you;we often beat that,but increased security screening by the post office can delay shipping time;we take full responsibility.... ..Questions and/or comments? Call 514 630 4518..We reserve the right to reject any bids we deem unacceptable,or not likely valid..Contact us BEFORE placing bid if you have a less than 10 rating...

    <Description>You are bidding on Warren Kimble Hand Painted "BARN" Salt &amp; Pepper Shakers. These are Charming examples of the Barn theme in 3D! They both measure approx: 4.75" x 3.75" Great! ........... Show off your love of Warren Kimble, Folk Art, or heck maybe just your love of the country! $5.94 total S&amp;H. *Take a look at the Warren Kimble Collectible Barn Plates I have below! ~~~~FOLK ART CHARM~~~~~ ~~Hi everyone~ Bear with me while I try some different things with my auctions. I have (I hope) gotten the automated Billpoint invoice system working on MOST of my auctions, but I have a feeling there will be some glitches for a while!! _ What I'm trying to do, is make it easy for you to see your total after the auction ends. You can get it: 1.) on the actual auction page itself, 2.) off a "Winning Bidder Email" sent after the auction ends that will supply a link to a check out if you prefer to take that route. My address is noted there. I May just send you you all the info if I'm really feeling gung hoat the moment! _ Okay, phew! Just so you know, I use Brand New top of the line packing materials. Fresh foam roll and thick craft paper. No used newspaper or funky boxes picked out of trash cans here! On all multiple orders, or item/s OVER 5.1 pounds they will go UPS to save you money as USPS can be outrageously expensive! I want you _ HAPPY _ I have up to 100 auctions going on at once, I'm pregnant, (Emily Katherine, due March 7th) have a wild 2 year old boy Christopher, 3 dogs, 2 cats, and a high maintenance husband so please notify me within 3 days of auctions end of how you will be paying and your address, so I can be more efficient and not go completely nuts! I'm getting a little slower packing as I have to pace myself lately, so if you are dying to get your package, and I mean tomorrow.._.., please let me know so I can work with you~! On the watches, I keep a number of every design in stock, but I can't predict how crazy things are going to get with the demand so it may take 1 to 14 days to get those in the mail depending on my stock. So if you are bidding on a watch and are concerned about when it will get in the mail to you - just ask. I'll let you know the time frame. Again, Per Ebay rules and proper etiquette I might add, I need to be contacted by you within 3 days of auction end. Payment within 10 days. I don't want to be forced to get the ebay fees back through filing a non paying bidder form! (Yuk)If you are going on vacation etc., please tell me that before hand. Positive feedback will be left IMMEDIATELY upon receipt of payment/clearance of check. Thanks for reading this all, most people don't so good for you!!! _ Hope this has helped and GOD BLESS AMERICA! _ This seller is an Auction Professional. They rely on sales from this and other auctions to pay their bills. Please do not bid unless you plan to go through with the sale. Under no circumstances will we allow Non-Paying Bidders to remain on Ebay. All Non Paying Bidders will be reported to Ebay in accordance with Ebay Rules and Regulations.

Click image to view larger version This is a neat black leather vintage purse - probably from the sixties or early seventies when the porthole openings were in style. The hallmark is worn, but it could say MARGOLIN. The bag is has a large carrying capacity. The interior of the purse has a goldtone framed purse, with a flipup clasp. The interior of the purse is lined in black twill and has a gold twill slip pocket. On each side of the center purse are twill lined open compartments, each having their own side zippered pocket. The looped leather strap can pull through and be used as one shoulderstrap, or each end can pull together for a handstrap. There are also four goldtone metal grommets on the bottom. For it's age, this bag is in pretty good shape. The strap itself has some wear and a bit of loose stitching - otherwise the leather is still soft and supple and the interior is great! Make a statement with this nice bag! Dimensions are 12.5"L, 10"H, 3.50"W. Shipping is through U.S. Postal Service with Delivery Confirmation. See shipping cost below.

    <Description>This is Larry of the three stooges bobbing head. He is holding a golf club. He is made of ceramic and are quite detailed. His clothing and the base have a texture to them, not the normal smooth finish. The picture doesn't do him justice. He is called a wobbler, but does not bobble or wobble as much as most of the bobbing heads I have seen. The 7.5" wobble head was produced by Creative Imaginations in 1999. He is brand new and in the original box. This is a great item for bobble head collectors and Three Stooges fans! Buyer pays shipping charge of $7.75. I ship UPS, so no PO boxes please. Please be aware of this when bidding. Thank you. Payments expected within 10 days of auction end. If you have any questions, please feel free to email me. I accept all major credit cards, paypal, check, money order, or cashiers check. All items are shipped next day with exception to check payments. These items are shipped upon check clearing.

If you are local to Cleveland, Ohio, all items can be picked up at Joshen's Bases Loaded at The Galleria in downtown Cleveland instead of shipping charges.

    <Description>Santa Bear item #9120 edition #78 was created by Tim Wolfe of Cairn Studio and is now retired. Santa Bear is 8 1/2" tall, is NEW and in excellent condition. A Certificate of Authenticity will be issued by Cairn Studio. The story card is included. The story is: "On Christmas Eve, young animals throughout all the woods and forests lie awake in their nets, anxiously awaiting the arrival of good ol' Santa Bear. For many of them, it will seem like the longest night of the year, as they are afr too excited to sleep.... After a long winter's nap in the North Cave, Santa Bear emerhes on Christmas Eve, dressed and ready to go to work. His red and white suit resembles that which is worn by his human colleague, Claus. Years of eating Mrs. Bear's cooking has caused Santa Bear's jacket to feel a bit tight! While St. Nick is nusy filling stockings for good boys and girls, Santa Bear will be delivering treats to little critters all across the land. His team of eight minghty mule deer will carry his sleigh from the Everglades to the Yukon - and everywhere in between. If you happen to notice this jolly and plump bruin sneaking through your woodlot on Christmas Eve, you'll know in a moment it mustn't be St. Nick...it's Santa Bear." Buyers to pay a fixed $7.70 shipping charge. Upon receipt of payment, item will be shipped via USPS Priority Mail the following business day. We will accept a Personal Check, with a 5 day hold, Money Order, Cashiers Check, or you can use a credit card and pay online with either PayPal or Billpoint.
