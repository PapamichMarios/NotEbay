    <Description>These 6 (six) elegant Large pew bows are the perfect finishing touch for your wedding! Your guests will admire them as they are seated and as they leave. They will be caught in the pictures and remembered forever! They are ELEGANT AND BEAUTIFUL!!!! A must for every chruch wedding! They were made by "paulasbows" who did a great job of making them! I would highly recommend her work. They were used once in August. I decided to sell them instead of store them. When I received them in the mail they were a little wrinkled/flattened. Paula (from Paulas Pew Bows on e-Bay) said to go to her website (http://paulasbows.bigstep.com/item.html?PRID=896089) and follow directions to eliminate the wrinkles. It worked perfectly. They look very good right now, but I would expect them to arrive a little wrinkled/flattened again. I would take care of them not long before the wedding so they will look fresh as can be. Buyer to prepay with money order and to include $6.95 for shipping plus $1.10 for insurance. Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>This full support open bottomed girdle features: Two inch Criss-Cross helanca elastic bottom gives ease of movement Satin Lastex front and back panel for firm tummy control Side sections are spandex power net Side zipper has inside hidden hook and eye close for a secure closing. 12 inches long Four attached metal garters. You should purchase these by your actual waist measurement. Keep in mind that these are shaper girdles and will fit very snuggly. These are irregular girdles so bidding will start at well below the retail price of $35.00 because they are slightly irregular. The irregularities in these slips is very minor if not impossible to see. There is some packaging soiling on some of these...not from being worn. The white color in these seems a bit dull to me.

    <Description>Brand new Oxxford men's sportcoat, size 42 long. (Check the measurements. The chest measures slightly bigger than a size 42. More like a 43L in the chest area) Brand new with tags and never worn or altered. Color is light greyish-green. Beautiful 100% cashmere. Luxurious and very soft. Medium weight..............(NOTE: you will see from one of the photos there are a couple very fine bumps in the material on the back of the collar. These are extremely small and fine. They are smaller than a pinhead and are almost impossible to see unless looking directly at the back of the collar and close up.)..................Completely handmade. All the seams, edges, lapels, etc. are handstitched. Even the seems alond the arms, back, etc. are hand sewn. You can see this in the photos......... You will see from the photos that this sportcoat is styled in the back a little differently. It has a small layer of extra material overlapping at the edge of the shoulders down to the middle of the coat. Also, it has a stretch of material sewn at the middle of the back, across the jacket. It looks vaguely like a belt. This is like an older style from the 1920's or 1930's................ Oxxford puts more time and effort into their garments than most custom made suits and coats. The absolute best quality in the entire world. Second to none when it comes to making quality, high end clothes. According to The Robb Report's 2000 annual list (a magazine for the affluent lifestyle), they top the list even over all the Italian greats like Brioni, Kiton, and Barbera........... Specs: Single breasted, 3 button. Non-vented. Pockets are hand stitched onto the coat. Inside there are 3 pockets on the left and 1 on the right. 26" from outside shoulder seam to end of sleeve. 34" from top of collar to bottom of coat. 46" around, when measured right under the arms. 19.75" from shoulder seam to shoulder seam, when measured straight across in the front............. I will give a 100% money back return if you decide the coat is not right for you. (Return does not include S&amp;H. Must be returned within 15 days of your receipt. Must be in same condition and unaltered with tags still attached).............. ............. Buyer prepays by check, money order, PAYPAL, or BILLPOINT. Buyer pays extra $11 S&amp;H. Will ship Intl, but buyer MUST pay whatever S&amp;H costs for shipping that includes a tracking number...............

    <Description>~*~Guerlain TERRACOTTA Bronzing Compact~*~ _ Description: _ Details: Full sized compact, brand new, never used. Guerlain "Terracotta Moisturizing Bronzing Powder" in Long Lasting No 2 is just what the doctor ordered to prolong your Summer color! This is the second lightest of the 3 hues in which Guerlain makes Terracotta, and the prettiest medium bronze shade. Gives your face a sun-kissed bronze glow as it melts into your skin without cakey build-up. Gentle moisturizers keep it soft and natural. Perfect for all skin types, but especially suited to oily skin. Get a believable, streak-free "tan" without the sun! I use mine as a coppery colored blush and eyeshadow when I have a tanning bed tan. Can be used all over your body...shoulders, along forehead, tip of nose, along cleavage...anywhere you want a hint of summer sun. Retails for $32.00 at finer dept. stores. Purchased brand new from a quality dept. store outlet, and savings passed on to you! _ _ _ Condition __ _ New _ Unused, untested _ _ Year Made __ _ 2001 _ _ Where Made __ _ France _ _ Manufacturer __ _ Guerlain _ _ __ _ _ _ _ View my other auctions _ _ _ _ Fixed Shipping Charges: $2.50 (Domestic) Will Ship Internationally I accept: _ - Money Orders/Cashier's Checks _ _ _ All items described to the best of my ability, and returns are NOT accepted, as I cannot guarantee product integrity once it's been mailed out.

This top is so soft and incredibly silky to the touch! Made of 100% Polyester.

I just love the gold sequins on this blouse, they just shine and shine and shine non stop, mesmerizing me so and the words, Saluti da Agrigento (I just don't get the meaning!) were slanted across the artistic picture, framed by the shimmery sequins! It's so IN and SEXY! It's a nice top and I shouldn't keep it doing nothing, it's a waste. So it's yours for a great deal today! Marked a size 28/42.

These hearing aids are behind the ear models and are one of the best and most comfortable hearing aids you can buy. The aid will fit the right or left ear and it has a 6 level volume control. The frequency range is from 250Hz to 6500Hz, with a maximum gain of 46 db to an average gain of 38 db. The hearing aid comes in an elegant navy blue velvet case.

    <Description>This dress is NWT. It is a size 12 by Tahari. The original price tag says $189.90. Is tailored and has shape...not just a long straight dress...this is very slimming...good condition. AUCTION TERMS __HELP ME PAY FOR MY WEDDING!!! I HAVE 37 WEDDING DRESSES THAT I NEED TO SELL ASAP!!! LOW, LOW RESERVES! __Please check our feedback and bid with confidence. __There are no refunds. __I explain items as completely as possible and pictures give the rest of the detail. __My pictures don_t always do the dress justice because I have a tiny apartment and can_t get far enough away from the dresses. __The shipping price includes packing materials and insurance. The cost to ship this wedding dress is $6, buyer pays shipping. __All items come from a smoke-free and pet free home. __All dresses are new, never rented, never worn to a wedding, store try on samples, unless otherwise noted. These dresses will need to be cleaned and pressed before they can be worn to a wedding. Some may have missing buttons, beads, dirt on the bottom, etc_ what you may expect from a try on sample. But, for the low, low price here, you can get the dress, shipping, alterations, cleaning, pressing and repairs for much less than what you would pay for the dress in a store. These dresses came from a bridal shop that closed due to illness. Many of them do not have a size tag in them, but I was told most of them are 8/10. I will always specify if there is a tag. If there is no tag and it looks like there is no way it can be an 8/10, I will tell you if it looks bigger or smaller. __If you like a dress that ends without selling, PLEASE MAKE AN OFFER. I need to get rid of these ASAP!! __Email me with questions __We accept PAYPAL AND MONEY ORDERS ONLY!! IF you pay with paypal, the money must be from a checking account, not a credit card. I do not want to be charged the extra fees involved with accepting credit cards. __THANKS FOR LOOKING!</Description>

    <Description>This is a cute size 24 months lot of two warm fleece outfits! The first outfit is by Old Navy and it is adorable! It is size XXL which fits 24-30 months, and it is 100% polyester fleece. The print is a black and white cow print, and the top can be worn as a shirt or a jacket. The hood of the top has little cow ears on top of it, and it has two front pockets. The pants are elastic waist. This outfit is adorable and is in excellent _as new_ condition! The second outfit is size 24 months by Babycrest and is 100% THICK polyester fleece. The top is Henley-style with three snaps at the neck, and it has a letter B with _All Star Player_ embroidered underneath it, body is navy blue and arms are forest green. The hood is lined with soft plaid flannel and the waist of the shirt is elastic. The pants are forest green with an elastic waist and elastic cuffs. This outfit is in very good condition with a small amount of pilling from wear _ fleece always seems to do that. Still a great outfit for the cold winter months! Shipping of $3.95 is buyer_s responsibility and insurance is extra, only at buyer_s request. I will also ship via parcel post for less, just ask. Payment must be made in 10 days from auction close or item will be relisted and I will file a non-paying bidder report with Ebay. I accept payments via credit card or bank account through PayPal, money orders, and personal checks. Personal checks will only be accepted with 10 or more positive feedbacks _ no negatives, and I will hold the check for 10 days or until it clears my bank. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>CYBERSONIC Toothbrush **NEW** as seen on TV BRAND NEW IN SEALED BOX! CYBERSONIC is a breakthrough, patented "sonic" toothbrush that works much like a musical tuning fork. This toothbrush and attachments are "tuned" or balanced like a tuning fork so they will resonate from side to side when they are exposed to sonic vibrational energy. Our harmonic resonance action creates small but high speed cleaning strokes per minute! Sonic vibrational energy is generated by a super high speed motor spinning at 250 cycles per second. The harmonic tuning of the attachments generate 31,000 strokes per minute, more than 10 times what standard electric toothbrushes produce. The high speed scrubing strokes DISINTEGRATE PLAQUE and BACTERIA, even between teeth and below the gum line. SYSTEM INCLUDES : ~CYBERSONIC Toothbrush with 8 FREE Brushes ~Complete Illustrated Instructions ~CYBERSONIC Power Handle with Charging Stand ~ Two CYBERSONIC Tongue Scrappers ~Two CYBERSONIC Flossers ~Four Pack of Sonic White Tooth Whitening Gel This sells for $119.95 plus shipping on TV - SAVE MONEY and Get yours TODAY!

The absolute essence of elegance, you will be dazzled by the subtle, beautiful color of these genuine potato shaped freshwater platinum pearls. They glow with a wonderful luster and rich dove grey coloration. Ecah genuine pearl is nicely sized, between 5-7 mm each. This stunning necklace measures a generous 32" in length. There's no reserve on this great piece, so have fun bidding! If you like this item, you're sure to love many of the other beautiful jewelry and collectibles I have listed - and if you win more than one auction the shipping charges will be combined, saving you money! Click here to view my other auctions! Want to see related items? Click on the keywords! pearl necklace Note that I now have two eBay names: rgelber and treasured_finds - but not because I want to! I've posted so many auctions up that eBay's search function stopped working on me, and splitting the auctions between the IDs made it work again. I made the auction pages look the same so you'll still know its me, and I will still combine shipping charges just as before, regardless of which IDs auctions you bid on. ( If the picture does not appear click here for an alternate posting ) I accept MasterCard/Visa and checks/money orders in US funds. Checks hold to clear, otherwise I ship within 24 hours. Buyer to pay $2.00 for first-class shipping/handling in the U.S., with insurance optional (but HIGHLY recommended) at $1 for each $50 of value. Seller is not responsible for lost items if insurance waived. Most small items can be shipped airmail overseas for $3.00. California buyers pay sales tax. Please ask any questions before you bid. Payment is expected within 10 days of auction close. Returns accepted within one week of receipt and are for bid price less shipping and fees unless the item received is not as described. Please DON'T use eBay's 'Checkout' on my auctions. In addition to being unreliable, it only works on single items and most of my customers bid on multiple auctions. Until eBay makes Checkout optional the button will be part of all auctions, whether the seller wants it there or not. Thanks so much for looking, and good luck if you bid! rgelber Visit rgelber today! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

Don't see your favorite? Check our "about me" page for an updated list of payment types we accept Great British Pounds (equivalent based on pre-determined rate of exchange), paid to our agent in London, however shipping is computed on US rates, as that is where the item is We do not accept credit cards directly ID Verified: Through ID Verify, our personal information was cross-checked against consumer and business databases for consistency. ID Verify uses a third party to check the information we provided and verified that information for accuracy. Why did we pay this fee? To assure our customers that we are a legitimate business, not some fly-by-night Ebayers here today, gone tomorrow. Bidders should verify their seller is ID Verified by clicking their feedback profile. It's an extra safety measure to be assured against seller scams. __ Invoicing: All bidders are emailed an invoice within 12 hours of the auction close, however they occasionally get lost in cyberspace. If it has been 24 hours since the auction has closed, you should send us an email and let us know your invoice hasn't arrived. Winning bidders must contact us within 3 days of the auction close, or you may forfeit the item won. Shipment: S/H quoted is using normal packing methods, within the US. If you are overseas, have an unusual packing request (like double boxing), or are a multiple item winner, contact us for rates. We do not ship UPS, we ship USPS and Fedex (including Fedex Ground). S/H fees are non refundable. No s/h fee is charged if goods are picked up locally within 10 days of auction close. Shipping discounts for multiple items purchased only apply on items closing on the same day, paid at the same time, shipped to the same address . MAIL SAFETY: Please note that we have started to see an very high delay in the mail. payments are arriving to us late, even though they were mailed on time, and shipments to buyers are taking as much as 10 days even though 90% of our sales ship priority mail. This is to be expected in these troubled times. EVERYTHING shipped by us bears our company name "Highland Auction Services Inc" on the outside of the package, and NOTHING we use as a packing product resembles any type of granular substance. Taxes: FL residents will be charged 7% sales tax. International bidders: Please do not ask us to break US law by marking your parcel as a "gift", we will not do so. Insurance is not available on some international packages, please ask. Bidder Judgement : We reserve the right to refuse/cancel bids by individuals with poor feedback ratings. If you are on our banned bidder list, this applies to all ebay user names within the same household. Please do not attempt to use your husbands, daughters etc.. user name to re-bid Guarentee: All items are sold as-is unless the item description specifically states otherwise. Damaged Goods: If the item arrives damaged or is lost during shipping and you purchased insurance we will send you the insurance certificate. Claim paperwork is your responsibility If the item arrives damaged or is lost during shipping and you did not purchase insurance we can not reimburse you.

    <Description>This auction is for an adorable pair of carpenter jeans for girls by Tommy Hilfiger. I bought these for my daughter, but they are WAY too big for her. I tried washing them, but they aren't even close to fitting her. So, my loss is your gain. They have the tommy logo on the back and also on the 'carpenter' loop on the left side. They have a pocket on the right leg. They have a zipper and button closure. They are from a smoke and pet free home. Shipping will be 3.95 and I will ship twice a week, but if you need something really fast, I will try to make exceptions. Please e-mail me with any questions. I am only accepting paypal right now because of so many non-paying bidders recently. Sorry for the inconvenience:( Thanks for viewing and have a wonderful holiday season.</Description>

This bag would go great with a black dress Please see shipping costs/methods and insurance requirements below. For larger items please click here to email us for a quote. All breakables and items valued near and above $50 will have insurance required. If the item is shipped via FedEx this coverage is automatic up to $100 in value, 40_ for each additional $100 coverage. For USPS delivery, $1.25 up to $50, $1.00 each additional $100. All uninsured parcels become the responsiblity of the bidder once said parcel is duly delivered to the appropriate carrier. DELIVERY CAN BE MADE WITHIN A 250 MILE RADIUS OF OUR STORE ON OUR LARGER ITEMS. PLEASE EMAIL FOR A DELIVERY QUOTE The following types of payment are accepted: money orders, personal checks*, and all major credit cards. Payment must be received within 10 business days in order to avoid negative feedback and being reported to eBay as a non-payer. This will also expedite shipping of your item. * All returned checks will be accessed a $25 service fee. Buyer to pay $5.00 for shipping and handling. All international bidders MUST email us for an adjusted S&amp;H quote! . Ma residents pay a 5% sales tax. SHIPPING METHODS: The bidder may at any time request the shipping service of their choice, to which will be added an appropriate handling fee. MEDIA: We have been shipping media items (records, books, etc.) by Media mail, but have experienced slow delivery times, so we are trying to move away from this service. Smaller, light-weight media items over 13 ozs. are still quoted for Media mail and the bidder may request a different delivery service. However, we WILL NOT be held responsible for the long amount of time any Media mail shipment may take. SMALLER ITEMS: Other smaller items up to 13 ozs. are shipped first class. All other items are shipped either Priority mail or FedEx. Usually anything over a few pounds is shipped via FedEx, hence the higher costs. However, their exemplary service is guarenteed, carries automatic insurance up to $100 in value, and is trackable with out additional cost. Any item shipped through the USPS Priority service without requesting additional services such as delivery confirmation can not be tracked, nor will we be held responsibility for its not being delivered (see insurance disclaimer above). LARGER ITEMS: Larger items such as furniture and such are shipped either with BAX Global or a local mover we use who makes east coast runs every two-three weeks. HANDLING FEES: Since our shipping department needs to eat (and we require him to wear shoes, please! ), and shipping materials do cost money (really!) all items have an appropriate handling fee. Basically, the more time and care taken to prepare an item for safe transport, the higher the fee. We do our best to provide both cost effective and careful handling of packaging your item. This fee is not negotiable and is usually reflected in all posted S&amp;H charges, or added to shipping quotes for larger items. Created by eBay Seller's Assistant Pro</Description>

    <Description>I am offering a blue print sweater from Eddie Bauer. this is a very nice sweater in excellent shape. Only worn a couple of times. It does not show any snags or pilling. This is a shorter length sweater. It hits me right at the waiste band of my jeans. That is why I am not keeping it. Just not a good look for me. I believe it runs more like a large rather than XL. Has that great Eddie Bauer quality. The winning bidder to pay 4.00 shipping. I accept Billpoint and money orders only please. good luck!! be sure to check my feedback!

They are guys jeans, but are basically unisex (they used to be mine ~ when they fit ~ and I'm a woman). I have inspected them thoroughly and they look like new - no flaws, "runs" or stains; just great Levi's quality with years of life left in them. Good luck!!</Description>

    <Description>Hot Wheels VW Drag Bus 1/18 Scale In STOCK!!! Description The 1st 1/18 VW Drag Bus by Hotwheels is all it was anticipated as being. It is a real dragster, in that it only has one seat, mid engine, and large back tires and a drag bar. The frame is a drag style frame. The body lifts up and has a metal prop to view engine and interior if desired. This one will go fast and will be a fun one to have. Payment and Shipping The high bidder pays $6.50 for shipping and handling for USA domestic orders. Shipping for international orders will be determined after the close of the auction. Insurance is optional and must be paid for by buyer with payment for item. Checks are accepted, but will delay shipment of your item for 15 days. Money order(s), credit cards and paypal payment(s) will expedite shipment. Good Luck.

    <Description>Koncrete Industries in Walla Walla , Washington runs 14 readymix concrete trucks, and each one features different graphics on its mixer drum. Many of the slogans employ a play on words. They're all Kenworths and Peterbilts, but when the folks in WW saw the incredible detail on First Gear's Mack mixer, they said, "We want one of those with our name on it, even if it is a Mack!" Well, I guess they couldn't decide which design to use on the model, so they had three different models made! Minimum quantity on a First Gear truck is usually 720 pieces, but because Koncrete was doing three at once they were allowed to have just 504 of each design manufactured. That makes this a pretty scarce replica. Add Water, Mix and Serve is the name of this version. That's the slogan printed on the mixer drum in blue block letters. The graphics are just like "the real thing," even if the model is a Mack! Add it to your fleet today, or give it as a special Christmas present. I have all three versions up for sale on eBay right now, so choose your favorite or get the whole trio! The Legal Mumbo Jumbo: Successful bidder pays actual priority mail postage &amp; insurance within the US, or actual air or surface mail postage/insurance charges to a foreign destination. Insurance is highly recommended. Payment accepted by check or money order, Visa or MasterCard (via PayPal orBidPay only), or Discover Card (via BidPay only). Money order or check must be payable in US dollars on a US bank, or a US branch of a foreign bank. If you send cash through the mail it is at your risk; I do not recommend it. If you decline insurance you assume the risk of loss or damage in transit. Insurance claims must be filed by you with the post office, as I am not an insurance company or a claims adjuster. Payment should reach me within 10 days of auction end.</Description>

    <Description>This auction is for a brand new official Sesame Street Elmo tshirt. Elmo is especially cute as he is surrounded by butterflies. I'm not sure of what size range this size "large" fits, so I'm including the measurements here: Measurements: Chest - 44" Length - 30.5" The shirt is 100% preshrunk cotton. The design is even two sided with a smaller picture of Elmo holding a butterfly on the back. I think it would make an adorable nightshirt! This would make a wonderful holiday gift - especially for Elmo fans! See my other auctions for clothing in all sorts of sizes among other things! Go for it! You won't be disappointed! Click here to visit my web site. Shipping is $2.50 via First Class mail (or combine with other items to save $!) + insurance is optional but without it I can't guarantee what happens once shipped. I ship Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and will ship within 24 hours of confirmation of payment* as these days permit. Payment can be in the form of check *(feedback ratings of less than 20 will be held until check clears), money order, or Paypal (instant transfers and e-checks only). High bidder will receive an email from me after the close of the auction. High bidder must make contact within 3 days of close of auction to hgisch@juno.com .

THIS IS A BRAND SPANKING NEW WITH TAGS 3 BUTTON SINGLE BREASTED SPORTCOAT FROM HUGO BOSS FOR THEIR PRIMERE BLACK LABEL! And its simply immaculate! This is my absolute favorite color for this time of year, a rusty, brown and light green blend, I mean these are the exact colors of beautiful Fall leaves. This is an amazingly attractive super weave amalgam of wool (51%), linen (34%) nylon (15%) crepe-like fabric, that has been perfectly cut and crafted to perfectly accentuate the form of your body....not to mention your stature in the eyes of all who are forced to enjoy watching you strut your stuff! It has to be seen and worn to be fully appreciated. Its awesome! IN BRAND SPANKING NEW, PERFECT CONDITION. This sportcoat is a light to mid weight, and comes styled with notched lapels, besom pockets, unvented, and fully lined. This coat also boasts buttons made from olive brown Ivory nut, a seed of a tropical fruit with extra high firmness, and natural grain and horn buttons three for closure and 3 on each sleeve, but with a few extra buttons in the pocket (in the Hugo Boss envelope, you know the one, the little black one...). Just one more point, have you noticed the way that many inferior (cheap) quality suits and designers place the 3 button closure too low down and too close together to really give the wearer the slimming effect that this cut traditionally provides?? Well, no worries here, its done right! These buttons are perfectly placed and spaced, WHAT MORE COULD YOU WANT!!?? HERE'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT HUGO BOSS AND THEIR LABELS: The HUGO BOSS Group HUGO BOSS is fashion. HUGO BOSS is lifestyle. HUGO BOSS is success.

    <Description>NWT HICKEY FREEMAN CAMEL SPORTCOAT 42L 42 1666526160 WE NOW ACCEPT CONSIGNMENTS FROM YOU...DROP US A LINE!!841 This is without question THE MOST EXQUISITE Hickey Freeman sportcoats I have ever seen! It is a brand spanking new three button single breasted, jacket that is made from one of the lightest softest 100% pure Camel Hair fabrics you've ever felt!! This coat is made from a chocolate brown and tan diagonally ribbed fabric that is overlaid by a mocha and white windowpane, its simple exquisite!! WITH ALL ORIGINAL TAGS FROM NEIMAN MARCUS, FOR THEIR DESIGNER COLLECTION!! THIS JACKET IS BRAND SPANKING NEW, AND GORGEOUS!! Made as the details listed below from their site attests, this current design really is a cut above the many we have offered in the past on eBay. Made for their Hickey Freeman Collection at Neiman Marcus, this suit's coat is single vented and fully lined in Bemberg, with 4 buttons on each sleeve in addition to the notched lapels and flap pockets. The coat is darted for accentuated fit and the appearance of manly wide shoulders with an athletically slim waist...(even if its not exactly the case!) THIS JACKET IS ABSOLUTELY BRAND SPANKING NEW, WITH ALL ORIGINAL TAGS!! Here's some info on HICKEY FREEMAN and their "labors of love" Fabric One of the first things you may notice when looking at a Hickey-Freeman suit is the elegance and finesse of the fabric. Textiles from the finest mills of Italy and Great Britain are woven from rich, lustrous yarns of wool and silk. The textures, patterns and colors are designed to ensure the distinctive, exclusive look that is Hickey-Freeman's hallmark. Canvas Front Construction Hickey-Freeman uses the finest canvas for interlinings, the canvas front is an exclusive light-weight construction that adds lasting shape and body to the coat front without the heavy stiffness of lesser quality canvas. Fit The Hickey-Freeman garment is immediately noticed in the graceful way the coat lapel rolls and in the way the coat front hugs the chest like a second skin. Bemberg Lining Hickey-Freeman coats are lined with Bemberg lining the "gold standard" of linings. Sponging/Inspecting While high quality fabrics and trimmings are pre-shrunk at the mill, Hickey-Freeman subjects these products to a second conditioning process to ensure predictable, uniform behavior throughout manufacturing and the life of the garment. Re-conditioning of fabrics, thread, pocketing, and interlining assures you of long-lasting comfort, fit, and appearance. Undercollars The Hickey-Freeman undercollar interlining is made of fine Irish linen. It is "married" to the undercollar cloth, a woven wool flannel (not a pressed "felt"). As a result, the interlining has resilience and body characteristics that are transferred to the coat collar. The undercollar is made of two parts, rather than one, to ensure an easy, natural "hug" to the curve of the neck. Silk Thread Most sewing operations are accomplished with silk thread. Silk provides strength, elasticity, and "memory" (it returns to its original length after being stretched) plus reliable color brilliance and fastness. Silk gives seams a soft, thin, and flexible characteristic while holding up to the constant stresses of daily wear, dry cleanings and pressings. Buttons Turned from the horns of the water buffalo and Mother-of-Pearl shells, Hickey-Freeman's buttons offer durability and a richness of color and texture that are unmatched by man-made materials. Hand Pressing Hand pressing sets the fit, style and appearance of each coat. Linings, darts, outside pockets, side seams, shoulder seams, front edges and facings are hand pressed by experienced pressers. Hand Tailoring The buttonholes of a Hickey-Freeman coat are hand sewn with long-wear silk thread over a fine twist-free linen gimp. Hand-sewn buttonholes yield durability with a soft, flexible feel. Hickey-Freeman's list of hand tailoring includes: Hand-fitted armhole and shoulder settings. Hand fitted vents. Hand sewn buttonholes and bar tacks. Neck hanger. Micro-hand-stitched label. Pressing and finishing of linings. Side and shoulder seams. Pockets. Collar corner and vent felling. All ensure that each and every garment achieves that perfect feel, the precise fit, and the lasting impression that makes a Hickey-Freeman feel like a second skin.

Making the Le Collezioni label one of the most respected, and most sought after labels in the world! AND AS A RESULT ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE!! (BUT NOT HERE!!) GIORGIO ARMANI is one of the world's premiere designers in large part because of the way he revolutionized the way jackets and coats and suits were worn. this piece adds to that legacy THERE WAS AN EXHIBIT ON HIS IMPACT IN FASHION AT THE GUGGENHEIM IN NYC. HERE IS AN EXCERPT FROM THE CNN ARTICLE: (CNN) -- It was the jacket that helped change the rules of fashion. In 1975, Giorgio Armani introduced what became known as the deconstructed jacket, a loose, informal coat that proved to be a radical break from the conservative or offbeat clothing that came before. New York's Guggenheim Museum recognizes Armani's considerable contributions in a retrospective that features about 400 of his fashions. The show examines the cultural impact of his designs. It's the first time the museum has dedicated one show to an individual designer, and it's said to be the largest one-man fashion exhibition ever presented in New York. The Armani company is now worth more than $2 billion with a retail network that covers 33 countries. "Fashion is at the heart of human expression, and is a mirror that reflects society and its culture," he said. "My philosophy has always been to help women and men feel comfortable and confident through the clothes that they wear, rather than to create decoration for the sake of it. This belief continues to be at the root of my work as we enter the new millennium." SO I HOPE THAT YOU WILL LOVE THE EXPERIENCE OF OWNING AND WEARING THIS COAT. BID AWAY!!

    <Description>This is a dramatic wedding gown! It is a new gown that I tried on once (bust didn't fit) but I don't wear make up, so there are no foundation lines or anything...I also put it on a dress form to take the photos. So there many be some missing or loose beads (faux pearls) or sequins but nothing I can notice. It is a sleeveless beauty that 'glows' in the light. I am 5ft 9in tall and the dress hung to the floor with me barefoot. Tags say size 14 and ivory color. A small bag of beads and sequins came with the gown. The dress form bust measurement reads 39 and the dress just fit. You should probably be a 38 or a little smaller for this to fit in the bust. I forgot to check the waist measurement of the dress form ...if you need to know it please email me. (I don't want to handle the gown any more than I have to.) Would look great with long gloves. ...I could go on and on about this gown but I think the pictures speak for themselves. I accept E BAY PAYMENTS ONLY. Buyer pays $15.00 shipping (Insurance included). If you have questions you need to email me BEFORE bidding. This gown is by Formosa Bridal(tag inside).

    <Description>This auction is for a COOKE STREET Aloha Shirt (( M )) pictured. this item is in excellent condition with no stains, holes, rips, etc. Color is white with blue sailboats. Tag says size M and cotton/poly blend. This shirt has buttons going all the way down, not pullover type. (for search purposes Kahala Tori Richard St. st Tommy Bahama Reyn Spooner Ono Manoa Jams Jamsworld)) I realize how hard it is to be buying clothes online, not knowing how it looks while being worn or if it fits right etc. My solution for this is to allow you as the high bidder to return the item after you receive it should you not like it AT YOUR OWN EXPENSE for a full refund of your winning bid. I will just relist it and sell it again, and you will just be out what it costs to ship back. Hows that, OK!?! Please read my terms twice so that you fully understand... High bidder to pay $2.85 for USPS AIR in the US. Yeah, postage went up July 1, sorry. Outside US slightly higher. I will accept PayPal, money orders, or personal checks, but will hold your personal check until it clears before making shipment. I WILL WRITE THIS AGAIN...I WILL ACCEPT PAYPAL, MONEY ORDERS, OR PERSONAL CHECKS. I'm sorry about that, but some people can't read and still insist on using Billpoint for some reason even after reading my ads. Check my feedback and you'll see that I'm totally on top of everything. Bid with confidence. Note: Bidding on items has been known to cause people to not receive paychecks on time, people to find out that their kids used their passwords and bid on items without permission, people to delete my e-mails by accident, sickness, sudden memory loss, deaths in the family, people to lose jobs, computers to crash, out of town vacations, emergency business trips, hardware failures, network outages, and people to move places of residence among other things. If you feel that by bidding on this item you will aquire one of these aforementioned aflictions, then DO NOT BID ON THIS ITEM!! I've heard um all and I'm sick of DEADBEAT BIDDERS!! I leave big negative feedback for deadbeat bidders. Another Note: Please do not send me e-mails complaining about what I charge for shipping. Usually I just charge what it costs to ship. However, if for some reason I should happen to receive more, rest assured that in addition to postage, your shipping $$$ goes towards brown wrap, bubble wrap, packing tape, boxes, packing peanuts, bubble mailers, rubber stamps, etc etc where applicable. If you do not like what I charge for shipping, then simply do not bid on this item. I EXPECT A REPLY to my initial e-mails and for payment to be sent in a timely manner...I don't think that's too much to expect, is it? Sorry for venting, but if I don't write all of this, you wouldn't believe the number of bonehead e-mails I get...

Waist is 32" Inseam is 32". These have a medium blue fade. The picture shows a white spot on the front of the jeans...it must have been a speck of dust on the lens...these jeans are perfect. Original price on these from Fashion Bug was $19.99. I bought them and lost weight before I had a chance to wear them. My loss...your gain. High bidder agrees to pay $3.95 for shipping in the US. Insurance will be an extra $1.20 at the buyer's option. International bidders email me for rates to your country. Paypal is preferred but money orders are ok also. Sorry...no billpoint payments at this time. Please browse my other auctions for LOTS &amp; LOTS more jeans (and other stuff too). Save shipping costs on multiple winning bids. Thanks!!</Description>
