    <Description>Fancy Red velour dress for Holidays Back interest! Please e-mail me with questions and I will be happy to answer them. This dress is pretty enough for the Holidays in a deep red velour with a lot of back interest. I took the picture with a white boa to show it as a costume that could be a Gangster's Gal of the 20's or more specifically the Lady in Red who was with John Dillinger?? The boa and hat are not included in this auction. It is a fancy dress outfit for any Holiday occasion. This is a deep burgundy red brocade figure hugging dress with hardly any back at all! Dress is size 14 in VINTAGE sizes...no more than 36 bust, 28 waist and 38 hips for this dress! I prefer Paypal and buyer will pay actual shipping cost.

    <Description>_ _ Looking for a bargain? _ Like most of us selling Gymboree, I'm not sure if these pieces are from the DOUBLE DUTCH line or FALL FROLIC.....I'm actually pretty secure in thinking that the top is DOUBLE DUTCH but I'm leaning towards FALL FROLIC on the leggings....I still think they make a cute set together but of course that's my opinion....In either case they are both size X-SMALL, old-sizing, which, according to the Gymboree size chart is for ages 9 months to 1 1/2 years, 30 to 33 inches tall and 23 to 28 pounds.....The leggings are in great condition......The top is in good condition with only normal wash wear......The Gymboree name tag is missing from the top but the size tag is intact.......I'm also including a tee shirt that I believe is from the FALL FROLIC line in size SMALL, old-sizing that, according to the Gymboree size chart, is for ages 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 years, 34 to 37 inches tall and 28 to 35 pounds....Nice condition with no more than normal wash/wear....Put this larger piece aside until the warmer weather returns!........3 pieces of classic Gymbo at a very low starting bid!........Payment is expected within 7 days and must include $3.50 for priority mail....First class is not an option due to the weight of these 3 items....Insurance is optional for an added $1.10 as the SELLER offers no credit or refund towards the loss of any uninsured item.....USA SHIPPING ONLY...I do not ship to CANADA....I accept PayPal and money orders but no business or personal checks!........It's VERY important that you reply to my confirmation email within 3 days...That way I'll know we've established communication and that you were sincere in placing your bid......I ship 2 days per week &amp; gladly combine shipping costs on multiple wins!.........PAYPAL USERS MUST WAIT UNTIL RECEIVING MY CONFIRMATION EMAIL BEFORE SENDING PAYMENT AS I HAVE ONE PAYPAL ACCOUNT FOR CASH TRANSFERS AND ANOTHER FOR CREDIT CARDS ONLY!!........Thanks for reading carefully and good luck! _ _</Description>

    <Description>The first time these were worn, the little one was helping Grandma paint (with acrylics) and splashed paint on them. I believe there is something to get the paint out, but I'll let you try. Or...they would be great play pants. Other than the paint, they are in such perfect shape, I can't just throw them away. Buyer to pay $3.50 shipping. Check out my other auctions, I will gladly combine your winnings to save you shipping charges. I accept money orders, cashiers checks or paypal with payment due 10 days from auction close. Thanks for looking!</Description>

    <Description>Like new. Never worn, only washed, as we hate the feel of new, stiff clothing. You are looking at a lounger or mid leg length dress by KATHY IRELAND in a size 4x. The way I have it folded shows you the detailing on the arm, scoop neck and bottom. There is a conservative ruffle of the same material as the garment itself in these 3 places. The fabirc content is 60% cotton/40% polyester. The measurement at the bust is 54", the sleeve is a set in style with the length of the sleeve from shoulder seam to edge being 17". (great coverage). The length from shoulder seam to bottom hem is 49". This will be so comfy for you. Don't let it get away. Bidding starts at $8.00 High bidder pays shipping of $3.95 Money order, preferred. Questions?

It is a size 44 Tall, and is in excellent original condition but does need a cleaning.

    <Description>Lot of 4 Assorted Gently Used Purses You are bidding on this lot of assorted gently used vintage purses. I purchased this lot at a Estate sale so I have no idea how old they are. All are in pretty good shape. Show some wear from use but nothing real bad. The Dooney Bourke has and organizer zipper compartment in the front, has some ink marks on the inside. Red Recardo Beverly Hills bucket purse is soiled on the inside. The LV purse is missing the shoulder strap and shows wear on the bottom corner leather pieces. The Coach purse shows some wear in and out and has some pitting on the back side as shown in the photo. Overall condition is good. Allie May's accepts pay pal, money orders, and checks. Winner pays choice of shipping. Checks must clear prior to shipping, usually 10 days. Payment must be received within 10 days of end of auction.(A169) Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

First is a darling little pink hooded sweatshirt with Minnie Mouse in a heart on the front, and mouse ears on the black hood; brand name "Disney Babies," made by Walt Disney Co. It is made of 100% acrylic, and the tag shows it is for infants 16 1/2 to 20 pounds. The paint on Minnie's face is beginning to show a little bit of wear, but the construction of the sweatshirt is in excellent condition. Next we have a long-sleeve sweatshirt that is light yellow in color with assorted flowers all over it; brand name "Garanimals". It has a yellow scalloped band on the neckline and solid yellow edging on the sleeves and the bottom. It is made of 60% cotton and 40% polyester. The front of the shirt does have some spots on it, and I am not sure if they will come out in the wash or not. The last item is a pair of 100% cotton bib overalls by McKids (with the golden arches) from the McDonald's Corp. They are a light green corduroy with red and purple flowers all over them. The area on the sides at the waist have elastic for a comfortable fit and they have a snap crotch for easy diaper changing. They have been worn, but they are in extremely good condition.

    <Description>GAG PARKING TICKETS - HYSTERICALLY FUNNY (Click to Enlarge) (Click to Enlarge) (Click to Enlarge) Description GAG PARKING TICKETS Hysterically funny. A cruel but funny joke. Each "parking ticket" carries a "$100 FINE." Just imagine the fun you're going to have with these. Imagine how YOU would react to see one on your car. The blaze orange color make them easily noticeable from a long distance away. These tickets are professionally printed on quality stock and look like the real thing. Unfortunately the poor photos do not show the actual quality of these tickets. They are very convincing until the recipient starts to read the fine print. These tickets sell for as much as $2.00 or $3.00 each in specialty shops. The fine print says: "This notice may be returned by mail, carrier pigeon, personally, or by an authorized employee of the Tooth Fairy. A hearing at the North Pole may be obtained upon written request of the registered owner. Failure to obey this notice within ten seconds after the date of this violation may result in the non-renewal of the license to drive &amp; the registration by of the registered owner. This notice may be appealed (yea, right) and adjusted by mail if supporting statement(s) &amp; any unnecessary documentation is mailed within ten seconds after the date of violation. If registered owner is not laughing uncontrollably with ten seconds of receiving this ticket, the fine is increased to $200.00 - Failure of the lessee of taxis or leased vehicles to obey parking violation notices issued by the Tooth Fairy during their lease may result in a warped sense of humor &amp; the desire to play pranks on their family and friends. - FAILURE TO PAY PARKING FINES MAY SUBJECT MOTOR VEHICLE OWNER TO FITS OF LAUGHTER. " Terms: Only $1.00 extra for first class mail shipping and handling, no matter how many tickets you want. (Canadian shipping only $1.25 extra.) I prefer payments to be made via www.PayPal.com with a Visa or MasterCard. Personal checks and money orders are also accepted but shipment will not be made until personal checks clear, approx 10-days). Guarantee: If for any reason you are not 100% satisfied with these tickets, simply return them postpaid within 10 business days for a full refund and your payment will be refunded minus the shipping charges. Payment and Shipping See item description above. Please pay particular attention to the end of auction terms. eBay's most successful sellers use Auctionworks sales management services! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

MORE PICTURES BELOW DESCRIPTION CONDITION excellent SIZE 14 WAIST 26" INSEAM 28" ATTENTION: Please do not use checkout, it is sending me unnecessary emails with attachments. I don't take billpoint so it doesn't make any sense to use it. I don't like opening any email with attachments. If you wish to pay right away with a credit card, click the paypal logo. Winning bidders will be notified right after the auction through Paypals automated service. Payment is expected within 10 days. It is getting too hard to hold things longer than that since I list so many items. Please don't bid unless you intend to purchase. It costs a lot of time and money to try and track you down, and then relist the item if I don't hear from you. Never a reserve! I do recheck measurements by measuring straight across the waist of jeans and then doubled. I do not give returns on sizing. I will furnish you with a picture to resell them on ebay if you don't like them or they don't fit. I take money orders OR paypal, NO CHECKS. Buyers feel free to use the instant purchase logo from Paypal on this site. You don't even have to wait until notification. If you win more than one item pay only once through paypal since they charge a fee for each transaction. 4.95 for shipping/handling priority mail. It's usually cheaper to try to win more than one item so I can ship together to save on postage.

The top has a wide collar,the skirt has a 9 in. slit in the back. Condition Excellent _ Ask questions before bidding please. No returns! :) S&amp;H is $5.50 on this Item (USA ONLY) I accept Paypal, Mo or check (but I hold checks til they clear) Payment must be made within 10 days of auction end! If you are outside the USA, please contact me before bidding. _ ****See my other Auction items**** This applies to items shipped First Class Only!! Note: As a seller it's sometimes hard to determine the exact shipping price on an item. Sometimes it might cost less then what I anticipate, and sometimes more. If it costs more, I pay the difference, but then again, if it costs a little less, I do not make refunds. I think that's fair. I charge only $2.50 for shipping because I ship First Class in a yellow envelope. The item is wrapped in tissue paper, then placed in a large zip lock bag so that in case it rains it will hopefully not get wet. I haven't had any problems so far, but I will ship priority if you desire. The price for shipping (and handling) priority is $4.00 on one item (more for multiple). I am also not responsible for lost or damaged items. If you are the high bidder and you'd like your item insured, please advise me before payment is submitted. Please disregard the ebay checkout method. You will receive a confirmation from me via paypal. All Items are in excellent condition unless otherwise stated. God Bless America and your family!</Description>

    <Description>Hotwheels Honda civic 1/18----COOL Here is a very cool and hard to get honda civic in 1/18 scale. These are very hard to come by and is one of the nicest large scale cars I have seen in a while. Shipping will be 8.00 in North America and I will ship world wide for the actual cost. Cars are mint and the boxes show some shelf life, bent corner or a crease in the plastic window. Get yourself a christmas present that you really want. At this point I don't think I can guarantee they will arrive before christmas.

    <Description>Cute Brown Polka Dot Dress Sz 5-6 Description This is a cute casual brown with white polka dot dress. It is by Channcey St. It is marked size 5-6. It has a pointed empire waist style and hangs loosley at the bottom. It has short sleves and a scoop neck. It feels like a cotton or rayon fabric, but I can't read the tag so I am not sure of the fabric. The way it is cut the sleves are not inlayed but part of the dress body. The back down is 45" long. It is a great warm weather dress. It is in great shape.

    <Description>Starter Youngstown Penguins winter coat L Nice starter jacket, clean, gently worn, the only flaw upon close inspection are a few missing top stitches. MORE PICTURES BELOW DESCRIPTION CONDITION very good SIZE large Chest 56" If you wish to pay right away with a credit card, click the paypal logo. Winning bidders will be notified right after the auction through Paypals automated service. Payment is expected within 10 days. It is getting too hard to hold things longer than that since I list so many items. Please don't bid unless you intend to purchase. It costs a lot of time and money to try and track you down, and then relist the item if I don't hear from you. Never a reserve! I do recheck measurements by measuring straight across the waist of jeans and then doubled. I do not give returns on sizing. I will furnish you with a picture to resell them on ebay if you don't like them or they don't fit. I take money orders OR paypal, NO CHECKS. Buyers feel free to use the instant purchase logo from Paypal on this site. You don't even have to wait until notification. If you win more than one item pay only once through paypal since they charge a fee for each transaction. 6.50 for shipping/handling priority mail. It's usually cheaper to try to win more than one item so I can ship together to save on postage.

    <Description>Click Here To View My Other Auctions This new pair of ribbed thigh high stockings are SO cute and sexy!! They are a beautiful WHITE and have a pretty chiffon ruffle around the tops and a satin bow in the front. I think they look best when worn a little above the knee for that innocent (but VERY sexy) schoolgirl look. They can also be pulled up higher and worn with or without a garter belt. I noticed that many of the lingerie models in the Fredrick's of Hollywood catalog were wearing thigh highs similar to these, but didn't see the stockings for sale in the catalog anywhere. They are "One Size Fits All" (4'10"-5'8" 95-160 lbs.) I will be listing a large variety of styles and colors of Thigh Highs and other NEW hosiery and lingerie items. Please take a look at my other auctions and check back from time to time! Click Here To View My Other Auctions If you have any questions about my auctions, Please click here to Email me. Terms &amp; Conditions: Shipping Buyer pays $2.00 for first class shipping for a single item. If you win multiple auctions, each added item is $.50. I will ship multiple items together as long as the auctions end within 7 days of each other. If you prefer priority mail, the shipping will be $3.50 no matter how many items you win. Items can be shipped insured at your option, for $1.50 extra. If you don't elect to insure, then any damage that occurs during shipping is at your risk. Shipments outside the USA will require special shipping arrangements. Please note that the $2.00 shipping also applies to "BUY IT NOW" items. Payment Payment accepted by personal check, money order, cash, and Mastercard or VISA through PayPal and Billpoint. Money orders, cash, Billpoint, or Paypal orders usually ship within one business day. Personal checks must clear (10 days) prior to shipment. Should you elect to send funds in the form of cash, please wrap the money inside a paper wrapper so that it is well hidden from prying eyes. I cannot be responsible for lost payments! For bidders outside the U.S., I accept payment by Cash (U.S. Dollars), BidPay, Billpoint, or Paypal. I cannot accept foreign checks. My bank charges $20 just to cash them! Return Policy Items are guaranteed to be as described. We offer a money back guarantee on purchase price less your shipping costs. Items must be returned within 10 days of purchase. You must return the items unworn and with the packaging/labels intact. Because hosiery items are delicate and very personal, we regret that we cannot accept returns on hosiery or bodystockings after the package has been opened.</Description>

    <Description>I discovered this gorgeous silk pocket square from private storage. I was given 3 Italian silk pocket squares as a gift,circa 1992. There are 3 (the others include an electric blue-violet paisley pattern and the other is a classic italian design of a dark red with deep green stripes and a thin white border) in my collection. They are hand rolled and edged, made in Italy and are from the Versace Fall Collection 1992. These have never been worn and are in Fabulous Mint condition. They measure 17"X17" and feature a dramatic and vibrant violin/guitar on black backround Now is your opportunity to own a piece of fashion history. I am selling each pocket square separately.

There are no rips, stains, or tears as it has been worn gently with care. It is button up in the front and 3 of the bottom buttons had to be replaced so they are not the same color as the outer ones. No one can see these buttons are they are covered with fabric. Back pockets have buttons so are very flattering to the backside. The inseams are approximately 28-29 inches. The color is stone and is a very light beige color. Buyer pays for $5.00 shipping via priority mail. I accept check, money order, or paypal. Please take a look at my other clothing auctions.

    <Description>This is a Blue and Black Steel boned corset by Versatile Fashions, size 25 (25" waist fully closed). Would best suit a waist of 26-32" (It can and will cinch you in 4-6 inches). This is a beautiful blue satin corset with black satin covering the boning and busk. It laces up in the back and has a back protector. This is known as their Gothic corset. I only wore it two times for a few hours a piece so it is in almost perfect condition. I bought this about a year ago, but ended up buying so many more corsets after that that it is time to clean the closet. This would be perfect to wear with a mermaid skirt or short skirt. I paid over $300 for this new! PLEASE NOTE, IF YOU HAVE ZERO FEEDBACK, DO NOT BID ON THIS AUCTION UNLESS YOU CONTACT ME FIRST OR YOUR BID WILL BE CANCELLED. I HAVE HAD WAY TOO MANY PROBLEMS WITH DEADBEAT BIDDERS. If you have any questions, please email me, as all sales are final. S/h is $5 in the US.

    <Description>This is a pair of Abercrombie and Fitch denim jeans. They are a size 2 with a 30" inseam and measure 29" around the waist. They come with a cute string belt that is not attached to the jean, just added accessory. These jeans are made of 100% cotton and are in great condition because I only wore them twice. They are a zipper fly with a metal button fly. They have two pockets on the back. All of my items come from a smoke-free environment. I used to work at Abercrombie and I am selling all of my clothes. Please check all out all of my other auctions, I will combine shipping if you win more than one. I accept check, money order, or paypal and shipping is 5.00 for these jeans. Thanks for looking and good luck bidding!!</Description>
