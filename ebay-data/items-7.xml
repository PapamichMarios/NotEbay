I've posted so many auctions up that eBay's search function stopped working on me, and splitting the auctions between the IDs made it work again. I made the auction pages look the same so you'll still know its me, and I will still combine shipping charges just as before, regardless of which IDs auctions you bid on. ( If the picture does not appear click here for an alternate posting ) I accept MasterCard/Visa and checks/money orders in US funds. Checks hold to clear, otherwise I ship within 24 hours. Buyer to pay $2.00 for first-class shipping/handling in the U.S., with insurance optional (but HIGHLY recommended) at $1 for each $50 of value. Seller is not responsible for lost items if insurance waived. Most small items can be shipped airmail overseas for $3.00. California buyers pay sales tax. Please ask any questions before you bid. Payment is expected within 10 days of auction close. Returns accepted within one week of receipt and are for bid price less shipping and fees unless the item received is not as described. Please DON'T use eBay's 'Checkout' on my auctions. In addition to being unreliable, it only works on single items and most of my customers bid on multiple auctions. Until eBay makes Checkout optional the button will be part of all auctions, whether the seller wants it there or not. Thanks so much for looking, and good luck if you bid! rgelber Visit rgelber today! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information.

    <Description>These are two of a series of Merry Miniatures that were brought out one each year starting in 1991. I am not sure how many there were in the set and I am only able to offer #2 and #3. The 1992 Marching Band Bear is brown and is playing a drum. He stands about 1 1/2 inches tall, in new condition with the original gold price sticker still on his foot. The 1993 Marching Band Bear is white and plays the flute. He stands about 1 1/2 inches tall, in new condition and also has the original gold price sticker. They are dressed in matching coats and hats, so cute.

    <Description>Wonderful vintage trim from an estate of a seamstress. Unusual to find in this lovely pastel pink color with a thread running through it that is a tad darker and shiny to give this a damask look or depth. Would be great for wedding, dresses, curtains, pillows and more. There are actually 2 pieces, both measures about 2 1/2" wide and 28 1/2" + long. Very nice condition with some folds from storage you can iron out and an occasional thread here and there. Nice details! No reserve, bid and win. Shipping in the U.S. Priority uninsured USPO $3.50. First class an option, $1.50. Insurance optional and at cost. If you win this on Thursday I will send you a winning email pronto. If you choose to pay me electronically by Friday December 21 before 10 A.M. EST I will ship on Friday. There is a good chance, if I ship priority, you could have this by "the big day". I have other trim and crochet lace on other auctions, check them out. Check out my other auctions, multi auction wins ship together and you save! I accept payments via PayPal, Billpoint, money orders and checks. If you are an international buyer payment should be International Money Orders or an electronic payment service. Please note that shipping international can get expensive and that you are free to check with me for a shipping quote prior to bidding. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

I just love this hat! It's just too cute! Made of an extremely soft, velvety black wool velour with a black satin hatband. Tiny little brim to sit cocked at an angle on the head. But the crowning glory has got to be that FEATHER! I'm not sure what type of feather is is (curly ostrich?), but it's really something: very full, curly and lush, designed to curl at an angle away from the hat. Feather tips/quills are covered with a rhinestone mesh cylinder, with the stones all prong set (and all there!) Has two small flaps to grip onto the head; they're double layered and have begun to separate, but just need a dot of glue. From The Halle Bros. Co., a now defunct high-end department store here in Cleveland. In excellent condition, no stains or damage (except for head flaps mentioned before). Size 22. Please check out my other auctions for more GREAT vintage hats, clothing and accessories!

Then there is an article on the "Hounds of Rambouillet",followed by pictures of prominent women of Chicago in Marshall Field dresses and where to find them, Jean Patou visits Marshall Field article, deco headdresses, perfumes, "gifts that make the home more charming", "dearest friends are sometimes hardest", The book section,"frilly and frivolous gifts"- accessories-gifts for childrens, undergarments, coats, dresses,sleepwear, furniture. all of these items are arranged more like a picture book than a catalog.

    <Description>ENCYCLOPEDIA of CARD SLEIGHT by Daryl Video Volume 1 (I do have the other 7 volumes and other titles by Daryl listed in my ebay store) L &amp; L Publishing is proud to bring you the most comprehensive video project to date. This 8-volume video series is a true encyclopedia that will provide card workers, regardless of their experience level, with all they need to improve their skills and broaden their knowledge base. L &amp; L Publishing continually hears from satisfied customers who say they picked up one of more volumes of this project and after viewing them have gone out to purchase the entire series. This is an incredible opportunity to learn about card magic.

    <Description>Darling little vintage baby blanket!!! Measures 35 by 46 approximately. Light blue and white. The design of cute little lambs is a reverse color. The lambs measure 5 _ inches. The oval design at the corners is 8 inch diameter. The edge of the blanket is finished with stitching. No binding on this one. There is about a one inch area where the stitching has come out. However, the thread is still there. Wouldn't be hard to re sew. These is a very small, light soiled area. Other than that, there are no holes, major stains or badly worn places. It has been freshly washed just for you. Nice warm, snuggly "blanky" for those cold winter nights. Lots of good use left in this blanket. Buyer pays S/I M.O./Personal check or PayPal. Checks will delay shipment until cleared. Payment to be received within ten days. THANKS FOR EBAYN' WITH US!!! GOD BLESS AMERICA Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

There are no dents or scratches. They have a panelled shape to the body. They are marked on the bottom "Towle Sterling 081". Thanks for viewing our auction. We want you to know that we do our best to describe the item up for auction with as much detail without going overboard. All items are usually purchased from an estate sale, therefore, they have been previously owned and/or used. We will never claim an item to be "Mint" for that reason. You may find something that is a flaw that we did not notice. We are not perfect. And, there may be times that as a collector there is something specific to look for that we do not know anything about, so it is up to you to ask the questions, and educate us along the way. We like and encourage that. Therefore, If you have questions, please ask and we will do our best to answer them. We accept money orders and PayPal. Unfortunately, we no longer accept checks due to losses that we have encountered. We hope you like what we sell, and if there is something you are looking for ask us, we just might have it, lol. Thanks for stopping! Payment I accept the following forms of payment: PayPal, Money Order. Low cost image hosting and full service auction management solutions: AuctionWatch</Description>

The Doctor and the Doll - (Doc is in the other room I guess!)... Each doll is an officially authorized reproduction, and is an original work of art with head, hands, and feet, hand-creafted of fine bisque porcelain, and hand tailored of the finest fabrics. What a lovely face! The Doll stands about 11" and her baby doll is about 3 1/2". The baby doll comes nude but with clothing. You see she is ready to see the doc. I dressed her for the pic but the doll you get will be brand new in box with a separate baby and new clothes. Doll comes with stand. Great item for the doll collector or the Rockwell lover.

    <Description>This genuine Armani figurine is an original work of art created by Armani master artists and based on the works of Giuseppe Armani. It is for his collectors that Giuseppe Armani creates and sculptures wondrously compelling figures out of space and air and imagination. Armani's almost mystical ability to put character and soul into his sculptures amazes and intrigues people the world over.

    <Description>This is a beautiful towel containing a white poinsettia potted plant. I have crocheted this using a hunter green yarn. A white button is sewn for hanging. It's a very pretty towel but appears darker here than it actually is. If you have any questions, please email me. Buyer pays $3.50 for priority mail for up to 7 towels. My asssortment is vast so check out my other auctions. Hurry and get inexpensive but unique presents for Christmas. (I live close to a 24 hour post office.) Thank you for looking at my towels.

    <Description>First of all I want to apologies for the quality of the pictures My digital camera just doesn't do well on large items. It didn't do this quilt justise at all. It is all hand made diamond quilting and embroidery, a average of 8 stitches per inch. The embroidery work is absolutely awesome. The lady that made this quilt in 1969 was 70 years old and this was her last quilt. A few things are not perfectly square with the quilt but are absolutely beautiful. The map in the center has a dot embroidered to show location of State capital. All 50 States have a square that shows their offical bird and flower,name of state # and year it became a state. Size is 100x84 Queen size the border is a beautiful red.white &amp; blue. Condition is excellent!! These map quilts are very RARE so don't let this one get way. MAKE A NOTE THIS IS A **3** DAY AUCTION!! Winning bidder pays sh/ins. Checks must clear 15 days. Paypal or money order preferred!! Please e-mail any questions.</Description>

    <Description>This is a very different Precious Moments Doll. She is made from a kit. She measures about 20 inches. She has a soft-sculptured face with painted acrylic eyes. She has a very very small snag above her left eye. Her hair is soft nylon, and has been sewn on. Her body is plush. She has a tear on one arm that needs to be re-sewn. Her outfit has a tag that says Precious Moments Kit. The dress is very nice. Looks like a Holly Hobby style. The dress alone is worth having, it's really adorable. Doll needs some cleaning.

    <Description>This goes back to my families cocktail parties in the late 50's/early 60's. This gorgeous"Academy" silver on copper(stamped on the bottom w/the #1120), 6 1/2" in diameter, Silent Butler was used to empty ashtrays during the party, and still be elegant......and it is. It has a black wooden handle(some paint is off...easily fixed). The lid of the piece is beautifuly engraved with an intricate pattern that is not easily seen in the photo The thumb piece that opens the lid is intricate as well. It is very well made. My Father was in the Copper and Brass business for 30 years...this was made by one of his "customers" and given to him as a gift. Its of very good quality. It has a slight bit of pitting on the bottom/indside...from limited use. A flashback to more formal times. I would say its in very good to excellent condition. MO/CC preferred. Buyer pays shipping and insurance. eMail questions welcome. This is a five day auction..in case you need it for New Years Eve !! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

MONEY FOR CHARITY A portion of all my ebay proceeds will be donated to ANIMAL SHELTERS AND/OR ANIMAL CONCERNS. Currently, I am donating directly to animal shelters in or near NEW YORK CITY. Many animals were left homeless by the tragedy on September 11th, as their owners were killed, left homeless, or called to service. The shelters are struggling with the expense of caring for and finding homes for these loving pets For more information, please contact NEW YORKERS FOR COMPANION ANIMALS PO Box 20247 New York, NY 10025 (212) 427-8273 NYFCA@aol.com PLEASE READ THIS: https://www.geocities.com/~nyca/ REMEMBER: There are thousands and thousands of good, loving animals in shelters all over the country. Many of them are euthanized, because shelters cannot handle the sheer volume or do not have the financial resources to provide for them. If you have room in your heart and in your home, PLEASE, consider checking out your local shelter. In thirty years, I have had dozens of pets, all of which were all adopted from shelters. They have all proved to be WONDERFUL, dedicated pets who provided me with love and companionship, brought me comfort and made me laugh. Even the scroungiest animals who may appear too old, poorly trained, difficult, or otherwise imperfect, can turn out to be the most loving, appreciative pet. They only need the love and attention of a caring owner. PLEASE ADOPT!! YOU WON_T BE SORRY!!! !!! Happy Holidays !!! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale! Payment Details U.S. Shipping and Handling $4.00 Shipping Insurance per item (optional) $1.10 Sales Tax (0.000% if shipped to none) _ Learn more about checkout Payment Instructions I will do anything I can (within reason) to assure that your ebay experience with me is a pleasant one.</Description>

    <Description>The Marina king-size comforter set by Fieldcrest features breezy stripes of coral and blue on a sand background. The set includes matching comforter and shams, along with a bedskirt in a complementary pattern. Keep a breezy, oceanside atmosphere in your bedroom all year with the Royal Velvet Marina comforter set by Fieldcrest. The king-size comforter's top is a lightly textured sand fabric with accent stripes of coral and chambray blue; the 70 percent rayon/30 percent acetate blend gives it a slight sheen.

    <Description>ANTIQUE LOOK MARINER STARS KING QUILT/QUILTS, ID# SM0115K; New; This striking quilt was recently brought into Kentucky; 90_x 100_--Great for a Queen- or a King-size bed; Comes with two matching shams!! 100% cotton fabric in blue, green, mauve, more. This eye-catching quilt has framed 4-Point stars in distinctive _on-point_ blocks which are color-set to create a 3-dimensional optical illusion. Although each block is pieced exactly the same way, some blocks appear to be rising off the quilt while other blocks appear to be receding deeply into the quilt. The individual stars are framed in patchwork and the central medallion is enclosed in a final, blue, double border. This remarkable quilt is hand-quilted, and it is an engaging quilt that would make a gorgeous wall hanging or show piece and is perfectly usable as a quilt. Notice the close-ups of a portion of this wonderful vintage look quilt and a sham. This dazzling quilt is new and has distinct graphic appeal! What a small price to pay for such an impressive new quilt! This quilt is fully guaranteed against defects in materials or construction. Please see our exchange policy on our web site. CLOSEOUT!!

    <Description>This is wonderful David Winter set. It is called Diorama &amp; Cameos set. It has all 13 peices, and all come MIB with COA's . A very hard to find set. It is mint condition. In the next few weeks we will be listing a large collection of David Winter items that we have taken on consignment, so if you are a collector please keep your eyes on our auctions as you may find just what you are looking for. Reserves are set WAY under value. Mulitiple bids saves on shipping. This set was returned to me , and relisted because one of the peices has a tiny chip. It is the Potting Shed, and it is miner, and if you like I can touch it up for you. As it is really not noticable at all. I never saw it. I also found it funny that at first they where going to keep it, and then after 3 weeks returned it. In any case I always tell the truth about any auctions I list.

    <Description>You are looking at a vintage pillowcase, 20" by 29", soft white cotton with embroidered pink/orange/lavender flowers, green leaves and lace edge opening. No discernible flaws. Maybe someone can use this as the basis for a cushion or quilt square if nothing else. Ships for 2.50, insurance optional. Checks take some time to clear; m.o., Billpoint and Pay Pal ship promptly. I use the post office 2-3 times per week, UPS once a week. Overseas bidders will arrange separate shipping terms. The fine print: please send payment within 10 days of auction close or I need to re-list item. Email me with any questions or comments you may have, and have fun bidding.

    <Description>Duncan Royale Pixie Figure This is the second, and hopefully last time, this item has been up for bids, and we have lowered the reserve! This Pixie figure is just the thing to brighten up a mantle or a shelf this holiday season! The pixie is in great condition, no chips or scratches. The paint on the figure looks as if it were brand new. This figure comes from the History of Santa II. It has the original labels on the bottom, pictured below. The number on the bottom is: 00324. It comes in the original foam packing and box; the box is in pretty rough shape. But nonetheless, the figure is just great! This is definitely a wonderful holiday gift for that special someone. Don't let it slip away! Thanks for looking, and Please Bid! Payment Details See item description and Payment Instructions, or contact seller for more information. Payment Instructions I accept Visa, Mastercard, Discover and GM, personal check and also money order. I will give response to the winner of this auction within 3 (three) business days of the end of the auction. I expect prompt payment, and in return I will quickly send the package out to you. Thank you!</Description>

    <Description>RARE &amp; LIMITED "Gone With the Wind" TALKING CARD HEAR IT FOR YOURSELF!! Click here to hear a sound bite, or press the PLAY button below!. This is a redeemed GONE WITH THE WIND TALKING CARD. This actual talking card was only available by Comic Images after redeeming a winner card found in packs (at a rate of 1 per case). This is the first version available, given only to those who redeemed their winner cards very early on. This is the much harder-to-find NON-CHROMIUM version!! This is the actual card that TALKS! When the button is pressed, card says "Frankly my dear, I dont give a damn!" (taken right from the movie!) Talking card is uniquely made. It is the height &amp; width of a regular card, but it is enclosed in a sealed casing that has all the "talking card" technology tucked away inside (making it thicker than a regular card). This is the ONLY talking card produced in this manner. Later talking cards from other card titles were larger shrink wrapped versions. This is the actual card you are getting, not the winner card ./P Winner will pay $1.50 postage and handling in the US. Insurance ($1.10 additional) is optional but recommended. It will be your only recourse in the event of loss or damage during shipment. All others will pay exact international rates. Winner agrees to send payment within 15 days. Thank you and good luck.

    <Description>All I can say about this is that it is in good shape and free of damage. Unfortunately, I don't have the box. Any questions, please e-mail. SELLING PREFERENCES: New Jersey residents please add 6% sales tax. Bidder pays fixed amount for shipping, handling and packaging. I will not be responsible for return shipping under any circumstances!! Total shipping cost on this item (provided you live in the lower 48) will be $______, with insurance mandatory and additional, as I will not be responsible for lost or damaged items in the mail. If you live elsewhere, BE SURE TO GET COST BEFORE auctions' end. E-mail me in sufficient time before the auction ends and I will get you an adjusted price. Shipping can sometimes be higher than expected, so make sure you find out ahead of time! Payment for item MUST BE RECEIVED within 10 days of auction end or NEGATIVE FEEDBACK will be posted on the 11th day. NO EXCEPTIONS! I only like to leave positive feedback for my bidders so please, if you cannot meet this requirement, either do not bid or notify me in advance of auctions' end. I accept PayPal, and Money Orders. PLEASE, NO PERSONAL CHECKS. Your item will be shipped on the following day after payment is received. All major shipping accounts will be honored, otherwise I will ship USPS Priority Mail (2 to 3 day service). If you have any questions about the above listed item, please e-mail me and I will do my best to help you. ********************PLEASE READ******************** I do not run auctions on a casual basis just to use my spare or idle time. Auctioning to me, is a serious business that I do not take lightly and expect that the others involved (on the bidding end) feel the same way. With this in mind, if you feel there is something in my auction you do not agree with, please contact me and I will address your concerns to the best of my ability. Whenever possible, I provide my bidders with a FIXED, not actual, cost of shipping and handling. I evaluate each of my items on an individual basis for such costs and these charges reflect the USPS shipping rate for that item plus a nominal fee to cover other costs such as handling, and packing materials needed to secure the purchased item(s). As such, my shipping terms are very straight forward and are not subject to reevaluation, unless there are sever circumstances where the item is either very heavy or awkward, in which case I usually state the total cost for shipping will be determined "BY YOUR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION". This allows me to give a fairer price for shipping and handling fees and cater to my bidders on a more personal level. In such cases, you are still subject to a FIXED cost for shipping and handling , so please do not complain after you are committed to the purchase. Since it is difficult for me to determine where a bidder lives, I ask my bidders to find out about shipping costs before placing their bids on my items, so as to eliminate any problems about shipping costs. One last note: I state that payment is due within 10 days of the end of the auction. This means that the total payment for the item (winning bid) plus the cost of shipping, handling and insurance charges are due!! If partial payments are made in error, I will contact you about the problem and expect an expeditious reply and payment. Please contact me with any further questions. Thank You for looking and good luck bidding!</Description>

    <Description>Here's 24 great Partylite mountain spring scented tealight candles! The best candles in the world! These are made by Colonial Candles of Cape Cod, the maker of all the Partylite brand candles. These are not seconds or picked over items! These are new, in box and purchased direct from the company itself. These make wonderful, all occasion, gifts, too! Buy some bath supplies, add some candles, put them together in a basket or gift bag, and your set! Unlike your store bought candles, which burn unevenly, have lead in their wicks, kerosene in their wax, not colored and scented all the way through; these do burn evenly, have no lead, no kerosene, and they are colored and scented all the way through! Each tealight will burn 4 to 6 hours each and they will liquify completely down to nothing, with absolutely no waste! Once you try these candles, you will never want to go back to store bought candles again! Winning bidder will pay $4.25 s/h. Shipping is based on weight. The more I can ship to you at one time, the more you will save, so you might want to check out my other listings for more wonderful scented candles to save on the shipping charges. NOTE: only 1 box of 12 tealights are pictured, but winning bidder will receive 2 boxes, totaling 24. Pay me securely with your Visa or MasterCard through PayPal!

    <Description>Early Wonder Womans are always hard to find,and sometimes appear very undervalued compared to similar period golden age.We are pleased to be able to present a nice early group in this and other auctions.All books are unrestored and original unless otherwise stated.WONDER WOMAN 10;solid and unrestored with supple pages that are mostly off white to cream.2 tiny chip outs are obvious,but the cover is NOT fragile in any way-the comic is structurally solid with an intact,solid spine. Also Note that this scan generally will overstate defects.Nevertheless bid with confidence! The grades you see are extremely accurate. (Read what the buyer of a $1000.00 AF 15 recently said about our scan-nov 28 2001 feedback, or just to confirm read the Dec 3 2001 feedback of a VF Green Lantern purchase OR read what a buyer of a nm Thor said"Pinpoint grading (an ebay rarity!) Recommend this seller.Dec 3 2001)).All grades are guarenteed within 0.5 of any grading service. The grade quoted above is an accurate grade reflecting the true condition of the book.(Any defect not revealed by the large scan will be discussed apart).The price is set so that you will be hard pressed to find as good a deal anywhere else.(This 33% bigger scan( than the books' actual size) magnifies and enlarges defects-it is like looking at the book through a magnification factor). Generally speaking the book possess's a solid intact spine with no splits;staples solidly in place;gloss and color deapth vivid,deep and close to new in appearance;only minor spine stress marks exist;overall a glossy off white to WHITE paged copy offered at an unbeatable initial bid ,with a LOW RESERVE(This low reserve allows our customers to use the buy it now feature.Many have missed out on previous books,and this feature usually prolongs the auction a bit longer to give everyone a chance to bid).As we have a large multiple grade inventory of Silver and Golden age books,many will be offered for sale in coming ads.There are many comics being auctioned off on Ebay this week.Combine auctions to save postage.THOUSANDS of other books are still to come including most Marvel and DC titles from 1960 -1972.Use the BUY IT NOW feature to end the auction and lock out the competition. We are multiple CBG award winners;EBAY Power sellers;and have 1000 total positive feedbacks(many multiple) since we began here about 2 years ago.Some may remember us for our full page Marvel adds starting in the 1980's.Our Marvel inventory is extensive and stocked in multiple conditions..Note.All our scans are "High resolution".That means a magnified, extremley detailed scan which is about 33% LARGER than the actual size of the comic.( so, of course, defects appear about 1/3rd bigger,than if you were viewing the item right in front of you)..Why do we do this?Why do we want the comic to have all the defects OVERSTATED? Here are the reasons; 1)All defects are CLEARLY seen.(in our opinion a small scan is of no use-the grade can be anything). 2) By revealing all defects,you can grade based upon what you like or dislike about a book. 3) No two grades have the same defects,thus a large scan allows you to delineate the key aspects of the book. 4)A large scan will OVERSTATE defects.Defects appear LARGER than what you will see when you get the book.(This applies especially to creases(thicker than actual),and stress marks,and to a lesser extent to color tones,which may show gradations in color not visible with the naked eye).Most of our customers note that the book is nicer when it arrives than what this scan revealed(reasons;the scans bright flood light reveal evey single microscopic impact point,plus defects appear 33% larger.) 5)All our books are guaranteed to be in the same general grade range(within+/- 0.5) if the book is slabbed(within 14 days of purchase) 6) Full exchange privledges on any item purchased.within 7 days. 7) Shipping : Cost; 5.00 for less than 5 comics(priority mail with delivery confirmation) in North America NOTE ;Allow 2 weeks for material to reach you;we often beat that,but increased security screening by the post office can delay shipping time;we take full responsibility.... ..Questions and/or comments? Call 514 630 4518..We reserve the right to reject any bids we deem unacceptable,or not likely valid..Contact us BEFORE placing bid if you have a less than 10 rating... All winning bidders must respond and establish how they will pay within 24 hours of auction completion. Further questions? 8) Paypal and credit cards accepted from most customers.We Will be glad to offer detailed answers,at our email address; omc@cam.org Click image to view larger version Low cost image hosting and full service auction management solutions: AuctionWatch</Description>
