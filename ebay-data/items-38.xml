    <Description>This is as rare as Mikimoto gets! A TRIPLE STRAND MIKIMOTO necklace. This absolutely stunning necklace almost never appears on eBay. It is authenticated as Mikimoto by a Certified Graduate Gemologist (GIA)-AGA. You have three strands of nearly flawless pearls with a total of 277 pearls graduating from 3.7mm to 7.3mm. Color is a very light cream with a very light ros_ overtone with a thick nacre--classic, high-end Mikimoto. Not least, the luster is simply superb. This is where it counts! The GIA appraisal accords it a very high AA status. (Another appraiser certified this triple strand necklace as AA+!) The strands are extremely well-matched, a Mikimoto specialty. When you're matching 277 pearls you must have thousands of pearls from which to choose to make one superbly matched necklace. This is why Mikimoto is renowned and it shows here. The strands are 15 and 1/2 to 17 and 1/2 inches long, with a sterling silver Mikimoto clasp adorned with a 4.2mm pearl. Both appraisals are available for your inspection. This is a no-risk Mikimoto triple strand! The photos don't even begin to capture the stellar luster and exquisite matching of this rare Mikimoto triple strand. Condition is absolutely MINT! Walk into ANY Mikimoto dealer and you'll see that a triple strand of this quality sells for $5,000. Yet the reserve on this triple strand is very near the WHOLESALE price! This is THE holiday gift of the year. Shipping and insurance are to be paid by the buyer. Payment is by cashier's check, Western Union or PAYPAL. BUY WITH CONFIDENCE!

    <Description>98 HOT WHEELS MATTEL 50th Anniversary McDonal This 1998 Hot Wheels 50th Anniversary McDonald's vehicle is bright bronze in color with very dark slanted windows. On the hood are the words "NasCar 50th Anniversary" along with the golden arches of the McDonald's logo. Measuring 3 inches in length, the number "94" is painted on the roof of the cab in yellow letters outlined in light blue. Wording on the bottom says "1998 Mattel Inc., Hot Wheels, Mfg for McD Corp., China CB Chine". There are a couple of of small scratches on this sporty vehicle; nonetheless, it would surely delight a young child's heart to find this in his or her stocking on Christmas.

It is blunt cut for added fullness and body! It is cut in that world famous Dutch Bob style with an awesome gelled look that can be gently washed out if you were so inclined! It also has full bangs for those of you who can't live without them! The color is a fabulous golden blonde with platinum blonde tips and highlights! We take great pride in taking detailed pictures of every wig we put up for auction. The wig you see in this ad is the wig you will get in the mail, although sometimes the shipping process requires that you restyle it on arrival. We do not scan pictures of the ad in the catalouge and then expect you to imagine how it might look in the color that is for sale. The reason is, that not every wig comes in just as is shown in the catalouge ad, every one is unique, and we want you to see it for all of its beauty AND its flaws. No editing and no airbrushing. That way there is no surprise when your new treasure comes in the mail! Shipping in the US will be $4.50. If outside US please contact for shipping quote! Insurance is also available! All My wigs Brand New and have never been worn. Every wig is adjustable in size from average to large. Thanks so much for your patronage and your time! We list new items every week.

    <Description>This is a pretty, 100% virgin wool, made in Italy, size Large, Club Room label. This is a design that cold be worn by a man or woman, and the quality of the knit is very nice. The color is what I'd call a dark plum, with little bits of blue-gray, black and white in an interesting abstract pattern. This is a great sweater to wear under a jacket. It looks "off the rack" and may be unworn. 48" chest, 38" expandable waist, 20" sleeve inseam, 25" outer sleeve, 16" bicep, 20" across back shoulder, 29" length. Nice! Please note that I ship only to the U.S. and accept only U.S. funds as payment. The address must include a street, city and state or a verified post office box. At this point, unfortunately, my method of postage will not accommodate APO addresses. In some cases, I will work with International bidders if they are willing to pay actual shipping and a higher handling charge. We need to work that out by email prior to the bid. Have you thought about using eBay for your Christmas gifts? You can stretch your shopping dollars a great deal! Following is my Seller's info that applies to all items. (Please click on View Seller's Other Auctions or search by Seller ID Duckfeed to keep up with my offerings. My auctions end at all different times, including daytime hours.) I will combine items for shipping to save you money. My maximum hold on items while waiting for other auctions to finish is 7 days. Payment is expected within TEN (10) days of close of sale. Please be sure to list item name and item number on Paypal or Billpoint, or with your money order or check. All items are sold "as is" with no returns. See my high-volume positive feedback, and you will see that I sell quality merchandise. I accept Billpoint, Paypal, money orders (and checks with hold if you have a lot of positive eBay feedback). Clothing I sell can be described as "better quality" clothing of a designer name brand purchased in Nordstroms, Macys, Saks, Niemans, Grodins, Talbots, Casual Corner, Ann Taylor, etc. All items are used, and most items look new. See my other auctions. I don't put anything on auction that I would not wear myself or ask my man-friend to wear. I have a long time corporate background and know what career clothing comprises the "dress for success" look. I am human and do my very best to represent items honestly, point out any flaws I find, and leave you feeling great about what you buy. I work very hard to offer consistent positive customer service. If I miss an obvious flaw in my description, I will deal with you with integrity. Colors are sometimes distorted, as it's hard to get all the software to work together with total accuracy. I try to describe colors. YOU MAY NEED TO DRY CLEAN OR LAUNDER THE ITEM, according to its label instructions, although some items will not need it. Because my profit margin is low and because the items usually get pretty wrinkled in transit, I do not invest in dry cleaning most items prior to sale. Just compare what you would pay for the item in a department store, and the dry cleaning cost will seem minimal. :) You will most likely need to press a garment after its journey through the mail. Please do not cancel your bid. We sellers appreciate it if you wait to bid until you are sure. Bidders who frivolously cancel truly jeopardize a seller's income and can scare other bidders away. Read everything carefully, and please stick with the bid if you bid. Be sure to look at the other auctions by Duckfeed. I have a lot of beautiful, quality clothing and vintage collectibles. Shipping/handling (by Priority Mail with Delivery Confirmation, insurance extra and optional) charge for this item is $5.00.

    <Description>GPR001 Ladymarquis Normal Ladymarquis 1 0 2001-11-09T22:59:00Z 2001-11-09T22:59:00Z 2 434 2477 20 4 3041 9.2720 Brand New Est. $1500.00+ Prada Womens Cordura, Pile and Leather Vest Size: 8 (U.S.), 42 (Italian) (Item #:GPR001) Detailed Measurements Follow Description: From the Prada Sport line, this vest is so cool it's hard to describe! First of all, it can be worn fully zipped via the two large front zippers and the fully wraparound waist zipper. Next, for a very sexy look you can unzip the center zipper which will show a 2.5" stretchy band of somewhat transparent black netting (and we all know what else will show!). You can "vary" the look by showing just as much as you want by adjusting how low the zipper goes. As you can see in the pictures, the back of the piece has a large velcro closure flap. I'm not really sure what this does, though. 100% guaranteed authentic, with all hang tags, certificates of authenticity and labels attached. It's hard to assess the value of this piece as it's sold out in the U.S. stores even at full retail. Pieces like this sell for $1200 to $2500 though they seldom stay in stock. Fabric Content: Outside Shell is a cordura blend of nylon, polyester and polyurethane with the feel of soft canvas. The lining is poly blend plush short pile fleece. The piece is trimmed in genuine leather. Where Made: Italy Chest Measurement: 36_ Waist Measurement: 34_ Length: 21_ Neck Style: Black Fabric Trimmed Labeling: Intact and Uncut Item Pictures Back Top Closeup Closeup of the top of the front when unzipped All zippers carry the impressed "PRADA MILANO" Mark Huge Label inside the Garment Tag Attached to Authenticity Card Label on the Back of the Vest Detail of Bottom Back of Vest Measurements Please note that many of the items are hard to measure due to their stretchy or otherwise _tough_ fabrics. My experience has been that Armani shirts, tops and sweaters run true to size. Therefore, I would recommend that you go by the size above in the listing and take all measurements with a _grain of salt_.

    <Description>IMPORTANT NOTICE I will be on vacation from December 23rd through January 5th. For me to ship your item before I leave, payment in the form of Paypal or money order must be received by DECEMBER 22ND. Because I wait 7 days to ship on payments by check, I would need your check no later than December 15th to ship before I leave. Any checks received after the 15th or Paypal or money orders received after the 22nd will be mailed on the Monday and Tuesday after I return home which would be January 7th and 8th. I will have my laptop with me and will be answering all e-mails and sending out payment information on auctions that close while I'm gone. I will also be relisting items while I'm away. Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays! MONEY BACK GUARANTEE ON THIS ITEM If you are not entirely pleased with this item, just return it within 3 business days of receipt for a full refund less any shipping costs you incur (to you and back to me). Presenting a fabulous suit w/pleated slacks from HSM. This is a newer issue with their "softly tailored" line of wools. The size is marked 54 long. Be sure and check the specific measurements below for all the details on fit. The fabric is soft and luxurious. The weight works year around. The color is solid gray. The jacket is a 2 button single breasted style, fully lined with a single vent. The slacks are double pleated, cuffed and lined to below the knees. The condition is . superb. The only flaw I could find on the suit is a tiny pin prick hole on the left sleeve near the shoulder (see the last photo). To me, this is a total non-issue. I seriously doubt anyone will even notice this because it's so small. Other than that, the suit is perfect. Here are the specific measurements: JACKET Sleeve (from shoulder hem to end of sleeve) 26" w/1 1/2" that could be let out. Shoulder (from shoulder hem to shoulder hem) 22" Length (from bottom of collar in back to bottom hem) 32" Chest (from side to side underneath arms while coat is laying down, then doubled) 58" PANTS Waist 50 1/2" w/3" that could be let out. Inseam (inside seam from crotch to cuff) 30" w/2 1/2" that could be let out to keep the cuff. Outseam (outside seam from top of beltline to cuff) 43 1/2" Some of my auctions may end during the day. Please be aware of this and bid early if you won't have access to the internet during the day. PLEASE READ ALL OF THE FOLLOWING BEFORE BIDDING: I use USPS Priority mail for shipping. For packages under 2 lbs, the cost is $3.95. 2-3 lbs. is $5.20, 3-4 is $6.45, 4-5 is $7.70. If this item weighs more than 5 pounds, I'll quote you a price after auction closes. If you want to know, just ask. Shipping outside US will be more. International bidders muct pay by Paypal, Bidpay, US cash or bank check drawn on a US bank in US dollars.

    <Description>This is a perfect dress for a fabulous night! The fabric is a brilliant green satin- which catches every bit of light- and a black velvet bodice. This fabric really gleams with iridescent reflection! I don't think the photos really capture this. The cut of the bodice provides a very flattering fit. The skirt angles higher towards the left leg. This style creates an attractive, elegant walk. A layer of crinoline enhances the skirt from beneath. The neckline is off the shoulder with a coordinating bow on the left. The dress is labeled a size 3, and it will easily fit a petite 1/2 or a girl size 14/16 without need for any adjustments. No guesswork involved; measurements are for a 32-34 bust, 27-30 waist, and a height of 5'0"-5'5". It is possible this dress will fit a ladie's typical label size 4. However, a girl of that size, who once borrowed the dress, commented it was a tight fit for most of her evening. This dress is in excellent, like new condition with no rips or stains! The price is great, too! This dress is perfect for Winter Formal dances and a great holiday dress for New Year's Eve parties. Email your questions. I accept Paypal, BidPay, Billpoint, money order, or personal check. Checks must clear before dress is shipped. Shipping is fixed at $5.50. Happy bidding!

They are sleek, fit every curve wonderfully and have that unique faded wash that seven lovers crave! Please email me with any and all questions about these jeans before bidding. The jeans are size 27x33...great for casual OR night wear! Shipping on these jeans is $6.00, and I ship as soon as payment is received! :) I really really prefer Paypal for all payments!

    <Description>Please read the description before bidding :o) SEXY Genuine AMETHYST pendent on GOLD Necklace This is a great amethyst pendent on a Gold toned Necklace. The chain is 18 inches long and I should note that it is not the same one as in the picture. The necklace is a bunch of little circles linked together. The pedant does look like the picture, the one I got is a little more lavender and less blue. I bought it on pulseTV.com for my sister and then she decided she would rather have her birthstone (pearl) after I had placed the order. I got this necklace at a good price with a rebate. I am listing it at the price I paid for it after the rebate. Some one should get this pretty necklace for Christmas. Here is the description as it appears on pulsetv.com_s sales page: This stunning Genuine Amethyst Pendant Necklace is perfect for everyday wear or a night out on the town! The exquisite cut and setting of the gem will accent any outfit and create a sparkling spectacle. Included is a beautiful gold tone necklace. Item has never been worn, I took it out of it_s packaging before I she changed her mind on the kind of stone she wanted. This is an awesome deal. For the price of getting at meal at Denny_s you can get yourself or a friend fun trendy jewlery. Payment: I only accept Paypal Shipping will be $3.95 and if desired insurance may be added for $1.10 Question? Please email me if you have any questions or would like me to send you the pictures.

    <Description>You are bidding on a beautiful 100% silk dress from Flora Kung II, New York, size 10. The dress has an unusual design in which the right side loops through the left side under the bustline, giving a soft gathered effect. This, along with the shoulder pads, make the dress figure-flattering. There is a zipper under the arm on the left side. The long sleeves button with covered buttons at the wrist. There is a dramatic v-neck, shown, and a slit in the front, also shown. Sorry about the color in the hem picture! The fabric is an _impressionistic_ floral, with teal green roses surrounded by sapphire and black leaves, on a white-on-white background. The fabric has sort of a damask look, although it is a lightweight, elegant silk. Quite a pretty dress for an elegant lunch or cocktail party! In excellent condition. Shipping for this item will be $3.50 priority mail, with $1.50 handling unless another mode of shipping is preferred. If you use the Buy It Now option, you can still have it for the holidays! I will ship internationally. Insurance is not required, but highly recommended. It is $1.10 for $50.00 insurance, $2.00 for $100.00, and $1.00 for each additional $100.00. Delivery confirmation is $.40. I can_t protect your purchase once your package is mailed! Thank you so much for bidding! Please bid only if you intend to pay for your item. It is very costly to list and pay Ebay charges if you do not honor your bid. Payment is expected within 7 days from end of auction. I accept personal checks with a 7 day waiting period for clearing, money orders and cashier_s checks, Paypal, and Billpoint. All items are sold as is, and all sales are final unless other arrangements are made in advance. THANK YOU, and GOOD LUCK BIDDING!!! Happy Holidays!!</Description>

We ship Priority mail because they provide free shipping supplies and we can easliy figure shipping costs. We do not try to make money on shipping, and in fact many times we loose money on it. If you feel the shipping costs are excessive, please DO NOT BID. Insurance is extra at the buyer's discretion. Most times, insurance can be added for less than 1.00, so we do advise it, as we cannot be responsible for items once we have shipped them. Shipping amount is for buyers who have a shipping address in the continental USA only. Please email us before sending payment if you live outside of the continental USA. We accept PayPal too. Winning bidder should respond by email (noland@cyberzane.net) within 48 hours of winning bid. Thanks so much for looking at our item. Payment I accept the following forms of payment: PayPal, Money Order, Personal Check, PayPal.

These products are top quality and all have the Coach leather hang tags as well as the model number inside. If you find that this product is not as described, a full money back guarantee is being offered. Please note, this does not mean that if you change your mind when you get the product a refund is offered. This offer extends to a misrepresented item only and is offered to assure you of its description and authenticity. Due to the volume of items being listed this week, only one photograph is being listed on most of the items. Do not hesitate to e-mail me with any questions or if you would like to see additional photographs for a particular bag. This is one of the most beautiful Coach bags that I am offering this week. It is model number 9426 and it is in the very rich bordeaux color. This bag is big and very impressive. Of all the Coach bags I am listing this week, this one out classes them all in my humble opinion. The bag measures 16 x 11 and it is nearly 6 wide. It has 11 handles and inside it features three compartments, the center one having a zipper on it. The outer pockets features a zippered compartment on one side and the other side has slots for business cards and pens. The whole bag is highlighted with nickel hardware. This bag retails for $400 and is being offered at a tremendous savings. Please note that I have two of these gorgeous bags for sale this week. Buyer to pay $8.50 shipping. Insurance is recommended. All items will be shipped via USPS Priority mail and if purchased before December 20th, you should be able to get this in time for Christmas delivery if you pay with a credit card via Paypal. Please note, I DO NOT use Ebay s CHECKOUT . You will be notified via e-mail within 24 hours of the auction closing with payment options and instructions. Please e-mail me with any questions.

HOLIDAY SHIPPING OPTIONS FOR THE USA We ship almost everything using the US Post Office. If the shipping charge stated is less than $3.50, the item is shipped via first class mail which is normally 2 to 4 days to anywhere in the USA. There is no delivery confirmation available on this and packages in rare instances have taken up to two weeks to arrive (way less than 1% of the time). Past history in shipping tells us that the Post Office actually does a very good job in December, yet with the volume of mail they process, packages do sometimes get misrouted. All items with a stated shipping charge of $3.50 or more are already shipped via priority mail, most with a delivery confirmation. Priority mail shipping with a delivery confirmation number sent to you is available on any item we sell where the shipping charge is stated at under $3.50. The cost for this is $4 and applies to the ties and most of the small ornaments that we are selling. If you want this service just submit $4 in place of any lower shipping amount stated and we will ship priority mail. Express mail overnight shipping is also available at a cost of $13.00 up to 8 ounces (single ties), 8 ounces to 2 pounds at $17 (most plates) and 2 to 3 pounds, $20. This is guaranteed overnight to most of the USA but may take two days to more rural areas. If you want to use this service have your payment in by noon CST or call me at 847-924-8744 and I will let you know if I will be able to get the item out that day. Any questions, feel free to call me at the number above. Please click here to see all of our auctions. We will not be shipping from 12/28/01 to 1/6/02, resuming on 1/7/02.

    <Description>NEW SILICONE BREAST ENHANCERS BEST ON EBAY These Silicone Breast Enhancers are made by the same manufacturer that sells to Nordstrom &amp; Victorias Secret. For contract reasons, I am not allowed to show the box cover for these Silicone Breast Enhancers. These upscale fashion stores are selling this item for up to $99. Fredericks of Hollywood offers this item in their catalog for $169. Now you can enjoy a fuller, completely natural looking and feeling breast instantly. This pair of soft silicone breast enhancers are far more advanced than the padded "Wonder Bra". They are slip-resistant and odorless. They move, bounce, sway, look and feel just like real breasts. Feels totally natural next to your skin, warms to your body temperature and conforms to you, enhancing your natural shape, play sports, and go swimming in your bikini with complete confidence. The model shown in these photos is a natural C cup, with the enhancers she became a full D cup in size.. Made of soft non-medical grade silicone, these Breast Enhancers can be washed with warm, soapy water then towel dried. These Breast Enhancers are guaranteed to last for years. These are not catalog photos, I took these pictures myself. The model is wearing a sheer lace bra that does not have lining. DETAILS Increase breast a full cup size. Enhance cleavage. Corrects uneven breasts instantly. So natural can be used for mastectomy patients. Great to try if considering breast augmentation. Can be worn while swimming.. The suggested retail price of this item in fine stores throughout the country is $49.99 to $99. Winning bid in the U.S. pays $6.00 for priority shipping &amp; handling, with insurance and delivery confirmation. Outside the U.S. pays $7.00 for shipping and handling. I believe in getting these items to my customers as fast as possible, so I will ship out this item Priority Mail within 24 hours of receiving the money order. I accept money orders, cashiers checks, and credit card payment through BIDPAY.COM . Sorry no personal checks. Payment is expected within 7 days of auction close. Your privacy is very important to me which I respect. Any personal information which is submitted to me will be discarded upon completion of our transaction. I made this auction private to protect you from unsolicited emails.

    <Description>FRENCH IMPORT _ CHANEL LES 4 OMBRES IN MYSTERES You are bidding on a brand new in box, Chanel Les 4 Ombres Eyecolor Collection in the shades _Mysteres_ which is one of my favorite color collections! This is a French import so the colors are domed and slightly different than the US counterpart (I think slightly more dramatic!) The colors are: Shimmery Rich brown, Shimmery Rose, Light Shimmery Cider and Shimmery Jade Green (a knockout color!). Highly pigmented, the eyeshadows can be used wet or dry to create an infinite variety of day to evening looks. A truly indispensable Chanel item you will love! Comes in a signature mirrored compact with two sponge applicators and velvet pouch to protect the compact from scratches. This item is imported and not available in the US,(the US counterpart is very popular and sells out quickly at Chanel counters), so bid now and get this very rare item here before it_s gone! As an added bonus, this product smells like rose petals! Also makes a fabulous gift! Please read the sale details before bidding, good luck! ********* SALE DETAILS ********* CONFIRMATION: Winning bidder must respond with their complete shipping address within 48 hours of our email being sent or auction is void and automatically passed to the reserve with NPB filing (we copy &amp; paste your address information to print the package labels to prevent errors).

    <Description>This pretty Gap sweater is 100% cotton with a great color pattern. The main color is bright red--brighter than the photo shows. It also has turquoise, gold, blue, and white. It is in very good condition. This sweater has a few snags (not very noticeable) but there are no flaws, stains or holes that I can see. It is a man_s size Medium, but I see no reason why a woman couldn_t wear it. It is 26 __ from the shoulder to the hem and 21_ across the chest under the arms. Sleeve length from under the arm to the cuff hem is 25_. Email me if you have questions. I have other sweaters up for auction, so take a look at them, too. I am happy to combine shipping for multiple wins. I specialize in high quality, name brand clothing for children, but I often sell other things as well, so there_s no telling what you_ll find! I add items most weekday evenings, so check back frequently. I accept money orders, cashier_s checks, personal checks, and Paypal. Thank you for looking at my auction!</Description>

    <Description>I have a beautiful pair of pants from the Gap. They are a brownish tan and retailed for over $60 less than 1 year ago. They are 58% virgin wool, 40% polyester and 2% spandex. They have a 100% acetate lining for added comfort and warmth. These are beautiful pants that I hate to part with, but they don't fit anymore. They can be worn as casual, dressy and/or business. They measure 34" at the waist and have a 30" inseam. The tag reads 14A. They are in super condition too. I don't think you will be disappointed. I will accept Paypal (not Billpoint) - account balances, bank transfers and MC/Visa. Let me know before you pay if you want to use a credit card. I will accept a personal check until someone sends me a bad one. Don't be the person who ruins this please!!!! Just a note on the personal check - it is fraud to send a bad check, so don_t get yourself in trouble by not paying for what you have won. I will also accept a cashiers check, postal money order, American Express or AAA Travelers Checks and of course, cash. If you are an International bidder, you will need to deliver funds drawn on a US Bank, but feel free to bid!!! Buyer will pay for actual priority shipping. It should be $3.95, but I will let you know for sure before you pay. You will only pay what the USPS charges me!!! I don_t work for the USPS and I don_t think it is fair to make money on their services. No scams here! :) Insurance and delivery confirmation are optional - $1.10 for the first $50 and $.40 for delivery confirmation. Just let me know if you want either or both. Without insurance, you are taking a risk! I would love to save you some money so I will gladly combine purchases. Please e-mail me with any questions. I have another job, but I will do everything I can to get back to you right away. Please e-mail me if you want more pictures. Thanks for looking. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>God Bless America! This is a nice pair of Lee Relaxed fit jeans for women. They are in great condition with general wear and a bit of wear at the seam edges and hemlines. Labelled as a size five-petite, they measure 26.5" through the waist and have a 28" inseam. A nice addition to any wardrobe at a fraction of the original cost. I normally post 180-200 auctions each week. I post in cycles by size, from the largest to smallest in mens then womens then back to mens with childrens and odd items thrown in between. If you see one pair you like, there's most likely a dozen or more in the same size range. The more you win the less the shipping costs, so be sure to take a peek at My Other Auctions!

I have these darling foil lined glass seed beads that frame each of the 18 Freshwater Pearls on each link! The Necklace measures 17 1/2" I made this one shorter for a young lady or woman with small neck and can be adjusted for the winner.

    <Description>This is the brand-new adidas T-MACs--the newest signature shoe of All-Star Tracy McGrady--from Adidas! You cannot find this in stores until February. Only Tracy himself is wearing these now. This is 100% authentic and comes with a promotional CD and original box. Don't miss out to be the first in the park, block, school to sport these! The shoe is a size 9 and is in black and blue. The shoe is made up of like a foamposite material with the adidas stripe logo "cut in or recessed" into the shoe (much like the KobeOnes) I have multiple pictures, but they don't do the shoe justice. These are hot-looking. These were never worn or even tried on. Dont miss Out! Shipping is $6 (USPS Priority) and I prefer Paypal, but money orders will be accepted. Sorry, no personal checks. Shipping is immediate upon receipt of payment. Good Luck!</Description>
