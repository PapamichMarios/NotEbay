    <Description>This is a brand new Billabong surf/skate sweatshirt, size men's large, with hood and front pocket. The color scheme is phenomenal on this and the picture does not represent it well. It is an off-white color (almost beige), with black, a few shades of gray, and a bright fluorescent green. One sleeve says BILLABONG in a light gray with a number of fluorescent green dots, as shown in the picture. Shipping for this item in the U.S. will be 5.20 plus 1.10 insurance (if desired). Shipping will be a bit higher to Canada. I accept paypal (preferred), bidpay, money orders (next day shipping after receipt), and personal checks (7 day hold after receipt before shipping). I will combine shipping if you win more than one of my auctions and you can really benefit - also ask about other items that I may be preparing to post for an even better combination deal. Please only bid if you intend to pay within 10 days and if you are able to contact me within 3 (three) days after close of auction (checkout, email, or payment by paypal or bidpay are acceptable means of making this contact). I reserve the right to reject bidders with excessive negative feedback. Unless prior arrangements are made including some form of independent verification, I only ship to verified paypal addresses (when paypal is used for payment). Please email me with any questions. Thanks for looking!</Description>

    <Description>This is a great looking, plush Barney waist pack! (A great companion piece to the popular plush Barney Back Packs!)See the photo, he's so cute. It has a plush Barney with an adjustable nylon strap and also has "Barney" embroidered on it. This is in fantastic condition. There are no pills on plush, no pulls on the embroidery, no stains. In overall gently used condition. His eyes have some very tiny scratches, the only sign that this was ever used. The plush is plump and soft, not matted or pilled at all.

    <Description>Up for auction is a nice Lands' End 100% cotton little boys sweater. I fell in love with this fair isle sweater and ordered one in the next size for my son when it went on sale at the end of last season. This was worn by my son last year, and I must let you know of 2 flaws on the back of the bottom right sleeve. One is a slight discoloration that is about 1" in length which appears in the navy piece of the back sleeve. The other is a slight tear in the yarns which is about 1/2 the size of a dime. Neither one is noticable, but I will have the tear repaired at the dry cleaners this week. It is such a nice, heavy cotton sweater that I didn't want to send it off to a donation bin just yet. Does show some wear, but I think it is part of the rugged look of the sweater. It will keep your little guy warm on the winter days to come. I can accept payment through PayPal (preferred), money order, or cashiers check. Please add $3.95 to the winning bid for US Priority Mail. An extra $1.10 is optional (but recommended) for insurance.I can not be responsible for mail lost by the Postal Service. Please contact me within 3 days of the close of the auction for payment and delivery arrangements. If no communication occurs within 3 days and payment is not made within 7 days, the item will be re-listed. Thanks for looking!</Description>

    <Description>You are looking at a practically new pair of girls gymboree shoes, the Amelia T-strap red suede sz 12. I say they are new because they were worn for a photo shoot in a mall for 1 hour! They are not scuffed or damaged in anyway, the bottoms are lightly dirty just from walking in the photo place. They are beautiful shoes and still in their original case. They are a sz. 12 and go to a dress outfit I listed on another auction. These retailed for 34.00 and would be excellent this holiday season! Shipping and packing 5.00 for priority, if paypal is used, I will ship next day. I also take checks and m.o.'s and will wait 4 days for checks to clear. I guarentee my auctions and this is a great deal! Thank you for looking! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>SPORTY Mens Womens or Teen XL DENIM JACKET. The tag reads, XLarge GAP Denim Jacket. It appears to run a bit smaller than XL to me. This is why I say that a teen would really enjoy this jacket especially since they tend to love the oversize/baggy look. When laid flat and closed, it measures 21 inches across the chest from armpit to armpit. 5 Buttons down the front with two upper outer pockets and two slip front/side lower pockets. NO holes, stains, rips. (Any yellow tints in picture are from Camera Flash-lighting). This jacket is in like new condition and would make an Excellent, High Quality, Affordable Christmas Gift. Buyer pays Fixed S/H of $6.00. I prefer PAYPAL. Payment Methods Accepted are Visa/MC/Money Orders/Cashier_s Check/Electronic Check Payments. Please be certain to ask questions as all sales are final and returns are not allowed. YOUR PURCHASE IS FULLY PROTECTED AS I AM VERIFIED.</Description>

Very Cute!! The other is a LoonyTune with Tweety on it. I had to cut that label out, it was bothering the baby. The other is a Solid White. That is brand new! Never worn. That is 100% cotton and is Made in Argentina. It is very soft. It has unique snaps all the way down to the leg. There are no stains, rips, discoloration, nothing.

    <Description>This would make the most perfect gift. Auctioned here is a Timberland Performance Polartec fleece long sleeve. This is a men's and is size XL. The fleece is brand new with original tags attached, still in plastic. It is the Basecamp model. The fleece is forest green with a black stripe on each arm. Polartec is great for the winter; it's made of climate control fabrics: it manages perspiration by letting the material breathe, it provides warmth, and protects you from the weather, especially wind. On top of the fact that it is super comfortable on the inside and out. This performance fleece retails for $100. Can have it mailed to the highest bidder before the holidays. High bidder pays $5 shipping fee. Please bid with confidence, as our rating is impeccable. Email with any questions. Thank you and GOOD LUCK! Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

What's great about these pants are that they are have double material on the knees and rear, great for active boys or men. They make great hunting pants, or just all around knock around pants. I find them very useful here in Arizona because of the numerous large pockets. I can find no other obvious flaws in these pants. The size is: inseam 26 _" to 29 _"; waist 31" to 35". These are very nice pants, don't miss out on them. I have 5 pair listed at the moment, various sizes, all are in very nice similar condition. Buy more than one pair and save on shipping. Shipping will be $4.05 Priority Mail. and could still make it for Christmas. If you are out of the USA contact me so I can give you an estimate of shipping to your country. Insurance will be an extra $1.10 for up to $50.00. I accept Paypal, check, money orders. Checks may be held depending on your feedback</Description>

    <Description>This is a NWOT Small Steps outfit, size 18 months. My daughter received this outfit as a gift and she never wore it. So it's been washed one and that's it. It's very cute but when she fit 18 months the season was off for this outfit. The top is a white ribbed t-shirt with three veggies across the top and the saying "Love and Veggies from the Garden". The colors are red, black, and yellow. The bottom looks like a skirt with leggings underneath, this one piece. It is a very cute red, black, and white plaid design, very cute. The skirt has a skort like look and has pleats in the front. Please check out my other auctions! E-mail confirmation within 48 hours of winning bid is appreciated.

I do accept checks, but will be held for TWO WEEKS from the day of rec'g them, to clear the bank. money orders and paypal are preferred, and have immediate shipping. we ship monday thru friday..due to the hassles we have rec'd at the post office, we no longer ship on saturdays. our week day post office that is close by is not open sat, and the other one does NOT like ebay sellers! sorry! thanks so much for checking my ads, and have a great day!!!!</Description>

    <Description>FENDI Silver Coat ~ Brand New with Tags ~ Italian size 42 Stylish and practical--a long, tailored coat from Fendi, lovingly made in Italy (ROMA=AMOR!). The fabric is a lustrous grey/silver--not space-age, just enough to get you noticed as you sweep into the theatre, restaurant, or club. This coat is very lightly padded, so it will be very warm. Some great details: pockets, Fendi-logo Velcro tabs, "Fendi Jeans"-printed lining, long walking slit in back (20"!) and tailored at the waist for a very, very flattering fit. This is an Italian size 42, which is roughly an 8, but may fit a size up or down--please go by the measurements: bust, 38.5"; sleeve, 24"; shoulder, 16"; length, 51". Brand new with tags; retails for close to $1,000. Feel free to e-mail with any questions.

    <Description>**SUPER WARM SHEEPSKIN FUR HAT/HOOD~ITALY (NR)** This is a very attractive sheepskin fur hood that will keep you toasty warm this winter. It has a label that says "Dyed Tuscan Lamb, Made in Italy". No size label; there are two buttons under the chin, so this hood can be a bit adjustable for sizing. I measured the inside rim around the face and it has a circumference of 25 1/2 inches (on the tightest button), or 27 inches on the loosest button); around the neck measures 17 or 18 1/2 inches. The pelts are very supple and soft and thick. The elastic loop for the buttons under the chin has some wear, but is still functional; otherwise, the hood is in very good, clean condition inside and out. You might like to check out my other hats too. I would be pleased to answer any questions you may have. Buyer to pay by money order or check in US funds and $5 for shipping to the US and Canada; other places, shipping to be confirmed. I also accept BIDPAY which allows you to use a major credit card. This has proven to be a fast and efficient method of payment and shipping. Go to bidpay.com for the details. Have Questions? Please email me. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>Here we have a super nice pair of black, size 5 1/2, flat heeled thigh high boots. These boots are brand new, in the box, and in excellant condition. They have 100% leather uppers and are fully lined for comfort and warmth in the colder months ahead. They measure 22 inches from floor to the top of the shaft. The heel measures 1/2 inch which will be great for the icy conditions ahead, especially for us northerners. Winter is almost here and these boots will be ideal for the snow and ice ahead. For you lucky people in the warmer climates, these are great boots and will look nice with jeans, slacks, or anything else you might wear them with. These are pull on boots. No zipper to worry about breaking. They have a removable ribbon at the top of the boot shaft that can be tied into a bow and can be used to adjust the fit at the top of the shaft. The uppers are of nice soft comfortable leather and will adapt to your feet quickly. Winning bidder to pay $6.75 for US Priority Mail to US addresses and insurance is optional for $1.10. I recommend insurance as I cannot be responsible for lost or damaged items once mailed. I accept PayPal, Billpoint, Money Orders, Cashiers Checks, and personal checks with a waiting period for check to clear bank. Winning bidders please contact me within three days after auction ends and payment is expected within 10 days aftere auction closes. Non-paying bidders should expect negative feedback to be posted.

    <Description>HAPPY HOLIDAYS! This auction is for an adorable outfit for your little boy, made by BUGLE BOY . It is size 3T and in virtually new condition (only needs ironing!) - even the tags are still crisp. The shirt is a dark blue plaid with medium blue plaind sleeves and pockets. There are 5 metal buttons down the front, one on each pocket and one on each cuff. The top is made from 100% cotton (machine wash cold). The pants are navy blue corderoy with elastic at the sides of the waist and around the cuffs (keeps the cold out!). There is no bib but the straps are adjustable to two lengths and button in the front. These cords are also 100% cotton (machine wash cold). Lots of pockets on the front - these pants make your little guy look like he's all grown up! These two pieces will make the cutest outfit and mix and match with so many other things in your son's closet. And overalls are so cute on little boys!! No stains, holes and very minimal piling/wear on these items! I am honestly not sure these were ever even worn. You will get lots of wear out of these pieces. And at this price you can afford to get several items (I LOVE eBay for kid clothes!!). Please check my other auctions for more boy clothes and other items in lots of sizes. I love to combine shipping charges and save you money! Just adorable items at a GREAT price! U.S. bidders only , PLEASE! High bidder pays shipping and (optional) insurance charges. Due to bad luck with deadbeat bidders and bounced checks I now accept Money Orders (via mail) ONLY or you can pay with a credit card via Paypal, but I ship right away (same day or next business day). Anyone who pays via paypal can get their item shipped within 24-48 hours of payment. I use priority mail so you will get the item usually in 2-3 days. There is still time to get these items by Christmas!! Please see my feedback for comment by lots of satisfied customers! All sales are FINAL so ask *any* questions you have before bidding. Don't hesitate to email me (at oneifiona@yahoo.com ) with any questions. If you write, please try to include the item number and the title if you can. Good luck with all your bidding!</Description>

    <Description>Thanks for looking and God Bless America! This auction is for a really cute pair of sweatpants from 1998. I was told these are from the boys Fairway (Golf theme) line. Size Small. Cute knee patches!! Good used condition with some mild fade. Shipping_ First Class shipping will be $2.50. High Bidder to pay Fixed Shipping. I ship in a Ziplock bag, so your contents arrive clean and dry! You may request insurance for an additional $1.10. Payment_ I only accept Paypal or a Money Order! PAYPAL HAS CHANGED THEIR POLICY_PLEASE READ_I am a personal Paypal member and they will no longer allow me to accept credit cards (this applies to debit cards also). There for I can ONLY accept a transfer of existing funds, an _instant_ transfer from your checking acct, or an _e-check_ which waits to clear. I am sorry_I am as upset by this as you are :O( If you are bidding in Canada, then you MUST pay in US funds via Paypal and pay actual shipping to you in Canada. My Terms_ High bidder must confirm the sale within 3 days of close of auction by reply to my e-mail. The high bidder must also pay within 7 days of close of auction (unless other arrangements have been made). If either of these are not done, the sale will be void, negative feedback will be left, and an Ebay non-paying bidder alert will be filed. I don't like having to include these conditions, but due to the many deadbeat bidders recently, I have been left with no choice. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

The coat measures 36 inches from neck to hem, 18 inches from armpit to wrists, and 54 inch chest/bust. This would make a great gift and it's machine washable too!

    <Description>A Horse is a Horse of course of course, Unless your talking about MR ED!. And thats who were talking about here. Maybe you can remember the words to the popular theme song from this wonderful show of a bygone era, but I'm drawing some blanks. This is a Mr Ed. talking hand puppet. Complete with his working voice box. Made by Mattel , in 1962. Good overall condition. Rubber on face area is not dried or cracked and is still supple, with nice features . Cloth fur like neck, is not torn, and is still soft. Yarn like mane is still in good condition. The voice box and pull string is original, and is working. He says several different phrases. He still has a good sharp detailed Mattel tag on his seam. He could use a careful cleaning, because of his age. A wonderful vintage toy to display and show off this holiday season.

    <Description>(BRAND NEW &amp; NEVER USED!) Japanese 6" XCEL Shears. This shear is designed for the professional stylist and is made of the finest high tempered steel for durability and sharpness, featuring the famous convex blade. The convex cutting blade is the sharpest type of edge available. The knurled tension adjuster is user friendly for simple adjustment for the perfect cut. This 6" shear is very sleek, slender and very comfortable for the stylist who preferes a medium too longer scissor, the fixed finger rest offers another desirable feature. This new scissor recently sold at the Premier Beauty and Hair show held in Orlando and retails in local salons for $225.00. There is a $8.00 Shipping, handling &amp; insurance fee in the US or $12.00 for Canada. (I will also ship to other countries but bidder must contact me by email and agree on shipping and handling fee, payment must be by credit card for out of country sales). Shipping is by Priority mail, if you prefer another shipping service the shipping fee could vary. Good luck and bid with confidence. I will accept payment by credit card or electronic check through eBay Online Payments by Billpoint, or credit cards through Pay Pal.</Description>

    <Description>Brand New Large Los Angeles T-Shirt - FREE SHIPPING!! "Laff for the day" If the police arrest a mime, do they tell him he has the right to remain silent? Brand new, never been worn. This is a heavy weight preshrunk 100% cotton shirt in white, that is silk screened with a Los Angeles California design that is real popular in Southern California and probably about every where else. I have other T's in other sizes and designs, and if you just click on "view seller's other auctions" above, you can take a look at them. This is a shirt I bought as over stock and is not a second or a blem, but the price is right, so have fun bidding. FREE SHIPPING: The successful bidder will not be charged a shipping charge at all for parcel delivery in the contiguous United States. If you live outside the 48 contiguous States there may be a very small freight charge based on the final destination point, and will be negotiated at the end of the auction. I have tried my best to describe the condition of this shirt as accurately as I can, please e-mail me with any questions you may have about it. Rest assured that it is in brand new condition, but is being sold as is. In the rare case of loss or damage during shipment, I will be happy to assist the buyer in any way I can. I accept PayPal, cash, and money orders as well as compliments, free advice, spare change, rides to the airport, free tickets to just about anything and even stray animals once in a while. Sorry, but personal checks on this item.. Thanks much for looking, and Happy E-Bay'ing! GOD BLESS AMERICA click here to e-mail me</Description>

    <Description>This auction is for a custom made dress shirt from New York. It was made by "Rich Shirtmakers", and is in very good condition. The fabric is pure cotton and made up of blue and white threads in a Mille-Raie stripe. Since the shirt was custom made there is no marked size. The neck measures 14 1/2" and the sleeves measure 32 1/2". It is fitted in the torso, and it has an unusual double button collar design. It also has gunuine pearl buttons. There is a hand stitched monogram that reads "AMS". There is never a reserve on my items and always a low starting bid. U.S. buyers pay actual USPS Priority shipping costs (minimum of $3.50). Shipping costs of international orders are subject to prevailing USPS rates. Insurance will be offered (minimum of $2.00). The USPS does a great job and has been very reliable, but I can't be responsible for lost shipments. I do not charge a handling fee for domestic or global Priority service with or without insurance. Be sure and check with me prior to bidding regarding other shipping costs. Checks, money orders, and PayPal are all accepted. Item ships once cash is in my hands. I try to be honest and accurate with my auctions. If you are not satisfied with your item just return it and I'll gladly refund your bid amount. Please check my other auctions for more great deals on high quality men's clothing items. Thanks and good luck. Scott</Description>

The pictures in no way do justice, this is one item you really need to see and feel in person, I guarantee that they bids would triple if you buyers could see or feel it! First of all, it is a pull over style sweater with shoulder pads. Long sleeves. And so soft!! Now, I will try to describe it the best I can, but it will be hard to do justice to it. First of all, it has crochet lace all around the neck line, and on the sleeve cuffs. Also all along the bottom of the sweater, Very delicate looking! I tried to get you a close up of it in the pictures. Next it has an embroidery design all over the front, and also has silver beading which you cannot see in the picture. Like I said, I really can't describe how nice this sweater is. I believe my aunt paid over $75 when she bought it and she never wore it and gave it to me and its been hang up in plastic so its in great condition. The tag says size 3X, here are the measurements: Bust is about 56"-58" and its 33" long from shoulder to hemline. Made of 66% acrylic 18% rayon 16% nylon. So soft and warm!! You are going to LOVE it. Put it with a nice pair of pants or dressy Skirt and you are all set for a night on the town! OR your favorite Holiday Party!

Ship $3.50 Buy 3 slips this week and I will ship free The good news. I am very grateful for your business. I answer all emails , ship three times a week and leave lots of positive feedback. NOTE***Because these are serious issues I must address them. Bidders having less than 5 positive feedbacks can only bid on one item unless you contact me .I have had several new ebayers bid on as many as 8 auctions and never contact or pay. Ohio residents pay sales tax, you dont I have to. International customers are welcome to bid on lingerie or small items. .3 days to respond You receive a notice from paypal with my name and address and one from ebay. Contact is very important as is payment within 7 to 10 days. I like getting a reg. paycheck for my hard work just like u do. LOL.14 days after end of auction transaction is VOID.I WILL NOT ACCEPT YOUR PAYMENT.And will file for a credit from ebay. Sorry, but I cannot hold clothes for weeks.SHIPPING, Insurance is avaliable for $1.10 for up to $50.00. Confirmation is $.40. Once I receive the receipt from the post office showing I mailed it to the destination requested I am no longer responsible. Most of my lingerie is vintage so it is not new.But it is always neat, clean and will have no major flaws that are not noted.I may miss a minor flaw. Keep this in mind before you bid ; if not listed as new someone else enjoyed this garment .(no refunds, no exchanges) Please see my feedback, and you will buy with confidence NOTE* Thanks to my many excellent customers and new ebay friends MUWO1 Payment I accept the following forms of payment: Money Order, Personal Check, PAYPAL or BIDPAY.

    <Description>HERE WE HAVE THREE SHORTALLS. ALL HAVE BEEN WORN MANY TIMES BUT STILL HAVE PLENTY OF WEAR LIFE IN THEM. ONE IS MADE BY JORDACHE, ONE CAME FROM THE DISNEY STORE, AND THE OTHER IS MADE BY CHEROKEE. ALL ARE 3T. THE DISNEY SHORTALL IS MARKED 2T, BUT THEIR CLOTHES TEND TO RUN BIG. MY DAUGHTER JUST GRADUATED TO A 4T BUT WORE THIS SHORTALL THIS SUMMER. THE PINK SHIRT UNDERNEATH THE JORDACHE SHORTALL HAS SIGNIFICANT STAINS THAT DON'T SHOW, BUT THEY'RE THERE. THIS IS A VERY CUTE LOT. MY DAUGHTER IS HAVING A VERY HARD TIME PARTING WITH ALL THREE. THEY WERE HER FAVORITES. THE MICKEY AND MINNIE SHORTALL TOOK AT LEAST 2 TRIPS TO WALT DISNEY WORLD WITH US. I'VE ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS LOT A 2 PIECE CAPRI OUTFIT. THE TAG SAYS 24 MONTHS, BUT IT'S WAY TOO BIG FOR THAT SIZE. MY DAUGHTER WORE IT UNTIL SHE GRADUATED OUT OF SIZE 3. IT WAS ONE OF HER CUTEST SUMMER OUTFITS. All of my items are from a smoke and pet free home. Buyer pays $3.95 priority shipping. Insurance is optional. I accept Paypal, personal checks, Billpoint and money orders. Personal checks are held until they clear. If payment is not received within 10 days of auction_s close, I reserve the right to relist immediately. Thanks for stopping by!! I am happy to combine auction wins. Please view my other auctions.

    <Description>This item is the Trivial Pursuit "The 1980's" Master Game. The game carries a copyright date of 1989 and I believe that this version of Trivial Pursuit is out of print. The game pieces are in like new unplayed condition. The gameboard shows no wear whatsoever and the game cards all have crisp pointed corners. The game is complete to include: the gameboard, the Code Card, the game cards, all 6 pie containers, all 6 pieces of pie in each of the 6 colors (36 in all); the dice and the instructions. The categories include: Personalities; Entertainment; In the News, That's Life, Sports &amp; Leisure and Wild Card.

    <Description>70's Nylon Shirt Steel Gray Pattern emo punk This slick nylon shirt is vintage from the disco 70's. It would have been a high class shirt when new, sold at Bill's Clothes in Cleveland. The gray, black and brown pattern is rather abstract, I can't figure out if it represents anything. Condition is excellent but for one bit of fray on the left cuff, otherwise looks great. From a smoke free home. Size is marked as M, but for your best fit refer to these measurements, taken on the outside: 40" chest, 18" shoulders. Shipping is $3.95 Priority in the US. Insurance is available at just 60 cents per $100 value. Click on the SnoGlobe to see a picture gallery of my other auctions. I'll happily combine multiple auction wins to save you money on shipping whenever possible. Book rate items cannot be combined with non-book rate items. Questions?

We suggest the following guidelines: 1._Select a seller with a good reputation (see feedback) 2._Be specific about the date you need the item when you send payment. 3._If using a credit card select a seller with a secure server. 4._Ask questions before you bid. 5._Inquire about refund policy. 6._Check seller's shipping rates. 7._Bid early. We have been selling for over five years on eBay. Together we have more than 3000 positive feedback points. We guarantee our merchandise to be as advertised and welcome queries regarding it. We pack and ship carefully without inflated shipping charges. Enjoy shopping on line confidently. ___ Meredith &amp; Dana S. Whaley ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ AUCTION CLOSING FAQ: 1. We ship in the order in which we receive payment unless there is an emergency request. 2. We ship twice a week. As a result, Buy It Now does not automatically mean Ship It Now. 3. Money Orders are treated the same as checks and do not speed delivery. We prefer checks because should they be lost in the mail they are far easier for the buyer to trace. 4. We do not, as so many others do, charge $4 &amp; $5 on shipping small items such as jewelry and we do not send jewelry Priority unless requested in an attempt to save our buyers money. 5. We recommend insurance for all items and will not be held for damage or non-delivery of uninsured items. 6. Postal Claims: Insured items do have a guarantee against damage or non-delivery. For damaged items it is necessary for the buyer to present the packaging and the item to the Post Office to begin the claim. For non-delivered items we will file a trace/claim with the Post Office and the Post Office will then reimburse the buyer for qualifying claims. 7. Please read our e-mail and follow our instructions for the fastest possible shipping. 8. Please include your item #, e-mail address and shipping address so we can serve you promptly and give you positive feedback on receipt of payment. No item is sent out broken unless advertised as damaged. We recommend insurance to protect the buyer. We make every effort to advertise items fairly and do not refund for buyer s remorse. If there is some question about an item arrangements for possible refund need to be made in advance of shipment. We are sorry, but we can no longer issue refunds for clothing.
