HOLIDAY SHIPPING OPTIONS FOR THE USA We ship almost everything using the US Post Office. If the shipping charge stated is less than $3.50, the item is shipped via first class mail which is normally 2 to 4 days to anywhere in the USA. There is no delivery confirmation available on this and packages in rare instances have taken up to two weeks to arrive (way less than 1% of the time). Past history in shipping tells us that the Post Office actually does a very good job in December, yet with the volume of mail they process, packages do sometimes get misrouted.

Priority mail shipping with a delivery confirmation number sent to you is available on any item we sell where the shipping charge is stated at under $3.50. The cost for this is $4 and applies to the ties and most of the small ornaments that we are selling.

    <Description>IMPORTANT!: Please read ALL the information below if you intend to bid or use Buy It Now for this item. AEF"s 1/35 resin Aliens line from the late 80"s/early 90"s was probably the most extensive US model kit line based on a science fiction film, EVER, kitting nearly every character, and nearly every *situation*, from that film! They were also designed to be compatible with the British company Halcyon"s 1/35 APC kit released at the same time. Also, most of the kits featured extra sets of arms, legs, heads and torso parts to allow the figures to be posed in several different ways during assembly. This kit of Ferro features two heads (one with sunglasses and one without), two sets of arms and legs, flight helmut, clipboard, hand gun (in and out of holster), an 11-piece dropship seat, and base. Ferro can be posed standing or sitting. Instructions feature a painting guide and personnel report on Ferro. Comes in a resealable ziploc bag with header card, which has been opened by me. Kit is complete and in excellent shape. See my other auctions for more kits in the AEF Aliens line! Please bid with intent to follow through. Winning bidders who do not follow through WILL find thenselves with negative feedback. Also, at this time users with less than 5 positive feedbacks are not allowed to bid on this item (This includes users of Buy It Now). I"m sorry to do this but I"ve had too many auctions end up with a less than 5 pos. feedback user not following through. I may change back in future auctions, but unfortunately this what I"m doing right now, with apologies to all the honest users out there. High bidders or Buy It Now purchasers, as described above, will have their bids cancelled or their purchases considered void, and will be required to pay back my insertion fees for that item. I also reserve the right to cancel bids by users whom I feel have excessive negative feedback I accept payment by personal check, money order, and credit card payments made through www.paypal.com.

    <Description>IMPORTANT!: Please read ALL the information below if you intend to bid or use Buy It Now for this item. AEF"s 1/35 resin Aliens line from the late 80"s/early 90"s was probably the most extensive US model kit line based on a science fiction film, EVER, kitting nearly every character, and nearly every *situation*, from that film! They were also designed to be compatible with the British company Halcyon"s 1/35 APC kit released at the same time. This kit features Newt"s family members - father Russ, mother Ann, and brother Timmy - from the "Derelict Discovery" scene that was cut for theatrical release and later restored for laserdisc and DVD. Included are a sitting Timmy with tractor seat, and standing Ann and Russ with what may be flashlights, one alien egg (closed), and two bases. There are no instructions. One reason for this may be because this set was issued near the end of AEF"s license and they may simply not had time. Comes in a resealable ziploc bag with header card, which has been opened by me. Kit is complete and in excellent shape. See my other auctions for more kits in the AEF Aliens line! Please bid with intent to follow through. Winning bidders who do not follow through WILL find thenselves with negative feedback. Also, at this time users with less than 5 positive feedbacks are not allowed to bid on this item (This includes users of Buy It Now). I"m sorry to do this but I"ve had too many auctions end up with a less than 5 pos. feedback user not following through. I may change back in future auctions, but unfortunately this what I"m doing right now, with apologies to all the honest users out there. High bidders or Buy It Now purchasers, as described above, will have their bids cancelled or their purchases considered void, and will be required to pay back my insertion fees for that item. I also reserve the right to cancel bids by users whom I feel have excessive negative feedback I accept payment by personal check, money order, and credit card payments made through www.paypal.com. The email address needed to pay through Paypal can be found by clicking on my eBay name, zed209, once the auction ends. Please note that items paid by personal check will be held 10 working days until check clears, I"m very sorry, no exceptions If you are thinking of signing with Paypal to pay for this item, please be aware that processing your membership may take 1-2 weeks and may not be timely enough for this auction. Payment must be recieved within 7 days after end of auction. Buyer agrees to pay $5.00 for handling, insurance, tracking, and priority mail if in the United States. International buyers, please inquire about air and surface shipping and I will obtain quotes for you. Item should ship within 1-5 days after receipt of money order, clearance of check, or transfer of funds into my account by paypal. If you have any questions or comments, please don"t hesitate to email me and I"ll do my best to answer them. Thank you for looking, and take care! Image Hosting @ BayPal BayPal</Description>

In the study, the 122 moderately overweight individuals who took chromium picolinate lost an average of 6.2 pounds of body fat as opposed to only 3.4 pounds in those individuals in the placebo group. "The data clearly confirm that supplementation with chromium picolinate can lead to significant improvements in body composition resulting from fat loss, particularly for individuals who may not be as aggressive in making lifestyle changes such as reducing caloric intake or increasing their physical activity." Gilbert Kaats, PhD, of the Health and Medical Research Foundation in San Antonio and lead investigator in the study. 100% Pure Pharmaceutical Grade Calcium Pyruvate 160mg : Calcium Pyruvate 160 mg : Pyruvate plays a crucial role in this conversion of food to energy. Pyruvate increases cellular respiration, or the amount of energy the mitochondria (the cells' metabolic furnace) use. The more energy used, the less the body stores. Ronald T. Stanko, M.D., at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, conducted a study involving 14 obese women (average weight 256 pounds), who were fed a 1,000-calorie liquid diet for three weeks. Those taking pyruvate lost 37% more weight (13 versus 9.5 pounds) and 48% more fat (8.8 versus 5.9 pounds) than the control group. 100% Pure Pharmaceutical Korean Ginseng Complex 125mg Korean Ginseng Complex 125mg : Ginseng is a popular antioxidant herb used to i ncrease energy , strengthen the immune system and to protect the body against the physical effects of stress and fatigue. Compounds found in ginseng help to combat harmful viruses and bacteria and certain cancers. The herb also has positive effects on the nervous system and one of its substances, panaxans, lowers blood sugar levels. Studies have shown that Ginseng is also a good appetitie suppressant. 100% Pure Pharmaceutical Nutritional &amp; MetaBolism Booster Complex : 200mg MetaboUltra-Max - Thermogenic &amp; Lipotropic Metabolism Booster 30 SOFTGELS PER BOTTLE - PRODUCT DOSAGE: Take 1 SoftGel Daily - Preferably 30 minutes before lunch with a large glass of water.

    <Description>This is a lot of 9 sleepers for baby boy OR Girl. All of them are size small-up to 11 pounds and medium 12-19 pounds. The medium sleepers look like they run small so I am listing them together. 3 sleepers have light/faint formula stains, the rest are in great condition. The Christmas sleeper says "Baby's First Christmas" but will probably be purchased after christmas. The other 8 sleepers are all lightweight. All 9 sleepers are the kind with snaps in the front. High Bidder is to pay $5.00 shipping. A personal check may delay shipment. Payment with Visa/MAstercard can be made through Paypal. I have more children's items listed and will combine winning bids to save you on shiiping. So take a look at my other listings.

Brief description: FAB Spain Citrus green kneelength leather jacket or coat with fur collar/hand cuffs.Made in Spain by Marco Universal. Retail at high end store in Europe for US$3490. This fabulous coat is made from genuine top quality lether and fox fur. The color is very unique, it is sort of like limegreen or darker citrus green, a very eye catching color. The pics show a bit of yellowish, and the actual item does not have that color. Also the texture of the fur is absolutely fab, it is not rabbit fur texture which is frangile and can fall off with wear. The fur collar and hand cuffs on this jacket are absolutely steady and well made. THEY ARE DETACHABLE too with hooks to be easily buttoned to the coat or other outfit of your choice. Coat has 6 huge size buttons lined with rhinestones. 2 side pockets and 1 inner pocket. Coat and fur collar/hand cuffs are fully lined. This is a truly stunning leather coat with class and timeless elegance! Size: Shoulder 19-19.5" across (shoulder pad), bust is 42", waist and hip are FULL 58" max, arm length approx 23" from shoulder to end of hand seam. Total length of jacket 37_.

WE WILL NOT BE RESPINSIBLE FOR UNINSURED ITEMS. Each item is individually wrapped with secure sealing. WE DO SHIP AROUND THE WORLD. ****SHIPPING COST: The following are approximate shipping quotes for SINGLE ITEM shipped from Hong Kong/Japan/ Europe to US, ACTUAL COSTS might varies due to total weight (i.e. multiple shipping) and buyers_ preference for insurance. Option 1: The lowest rate is to ship by REGISTERED airmail (takes 7-10 days), signature required upon delivery, item track able with shipping # provided by local post office in the shipping countries, but no insurance available, item will not be compensated if post office confirms its loss. US$7.95 for item less than 300g. For heavier item, cost will be prorated at extra US$0.50 every 10g. THIS SHPPING OPTION IS ONLY PROVIDED FOR AUCTION ITEMS WITH ENDING BID VALUE US$100.

PLEASE DO NOT BID ON ITEM (S) IF BIDDERS CONSIDERED this SHIPPING option TOO EXPENSIVE. Option 3: Other private carriers, such as UPS/FedEx/DHL might have faster delivery service, such as next day delivery or 2 days delivery, but sometimes we find that the services provided by these carriers might not be that reliable since we had buyers who told us they left the packages by the door and packages had been lost without compensation. Also, the min cost is around US$ 55 for les than 0.5 kg. We do not recommend sending with this option unless the buyer specifically chooses it. ****Returns and item condition: ALL SALES ARE FINAL.

    <Description>MJCami NEW MARC JACOBS SILK BLOUSED CAMISOLE SZ LARGE click for larger image MJCami3.jpg MJCami4.jpg _ Up for auction is a new MARC by Marc Jacobs silk, bloused camisole in LARGE. Marc Jacobs makes every chic lady's heart flutter with his Marc line. Okay, I fell in love with this one as soon as I saw it in Neiman Marcus. The silk exterior is done in a delicate shade of light gold and the material drapes over you like a dream!. The top is gathered for a flattering fit on the sides, around the bottom which creates a bloused effect. Very hot look this Fall! The overall look is simply adorable. Pair it up with dressy pants, skirt or wear it under a suit. Works very well with denims too. Thin spaghetti straps complete the look. Falls to natural waist. Here are some measurement: Size Large, but if you like more blousson effect, a Medium can still wear it. Color is Light Gold, very classy and subtle. Retails for $118 at Neiman Marcus, tag is still attached. Made from 100% silk Visit my other auctions for more Marc Jacobs and other designer pieces. Shipping can be combined. I welcome questions. Shipping will be $5.50 via USPS Priority Mail with delivery confirmation. Paypal, Billpoint, MO and cashiers check are the preferred methods of payment.

Sorry I can not insure international shipments. We DO accept International Buyers! Yeah, I know the auction page says that we don't but, Andale won't let me configure it any other way. We LOVE the international customers we have in Canada, Hong Kong and France and we will continue to ship internationally. There may be an additional cost for international shipping.

To use my fast, easy, and secure checkout, just click on the link in the email or on the Checkout logo in this ad. At my checkout --powered by Andale-- please enter your shipping address and other information so I can calculate a final price and ship your purchase quickly. andale andalecheckout About urban pioneer Condition Definition: Please contact me with any questions you might have before the end of the auction. I will be more than happy to provide you with additional pictures, close-ups of fabric, and measurements. I want you to be confident that you are bidding on an item that you really want and like. New Condition, tags are still on item. Minimum bid will be slightly higher than most others on my auctions. Great Condition, items has been worn once or twice. No stains or tears. Good Condition, item has been worn several times. Should be considered gently worn and there may be some stains or tears. Terms of the Auction: All items have been previously owned and worn. Before shipping, I have either dry-cleaned or laundered your purchase. I do use fabric softener so let me know if you would like me to prepare your item in a special way. All items also come from a smoke and pet free home. All known imperfections have been listed above. Please contact me for further information on a particular item. I will be more than happy to provide you with detailed pictures. Please use common sense when bidding. Do not overbid on an item and then expect a return or expect to pull out because you are "disappointed". You are not going to find real gemstones under the heading for costume jewelry. You are not going to find new condition upscale brand name items selling for $2.00. Return Policy: All sales should be considered final. If you are unclear on the concept of bidding on an item at auction please ask questions first. This experience is very different from going to the mall and making a purchase. There are always extenuating circumstances. If you sincerely believe this applies to you contact me and we will work to resolve the issue. This does not mean that you will be granted a refund. If you receive an item and it "isn't what you expected", too bad. I make every effort to make sure that all information on an item is provided. If you aren't sure, then ask questions. If you still aren't sure then don't bid. Sorry to have to be tough on this but there too many people bidding who aren't serious about buying.

    <Description>A great looking white jacket from the LIMITED COLLECTION in a size medium. It is double breasted with just the very last button on the bottom being the only one that actually buttons. It is completely lined, has softly padded shoulders and 3 faux front pockets. Very elegant looking and a great choice for a business look. It is made of 55% linen and 45% rayon. Condition is great, I do want to note however that on the collar is a tiny light blue spot. It is really not even noticeable and I'm not sure if it just rubbed up against something or what but I want to make sure that the buyer is aware. Nonetheless it is a beautiful jacket. Measurements are: Chest-36", sleeves-23 3/4" and length-31". Shipping in the US $6.00.</Description>

    <Description>This is a like new LL Bean wool car coat in a size 20. It is a very warm and comfortable coat. (See scan - the scan really does not do it justice as the camera does not pick up well) Of course it is machine washable and is free of any rips, stains, or other defects. It is a traditionally styled LL Bean coat. This is an awesome coat with LL Bean quality which will last for years and years. This is an awesome coat built to last and retails for 9.99 + tax!! As far as I can tell this is in perfect condition. As always I guarentee each item - check my feedback. I am moving into my RV so everything must go. (However, if this one doesn't sell it will not break my heart as it is a keeper!!)Buyer to pay 10.00 S/H priority in the US. I require any item over $9.99 to have full value insurance and this item will not be an exception. Please don't bid if you don't intend to follow through as ebay makes it impossible for sellers to contact the runner-up bidder - so I will pursue payment from you. Cashier's check, money order or Paypal for the full amount is required within 10 days. (I apologize to responsible bidders for wasting your time with this stuff!) If you have any questions email me. Thanks for looking and Good Luck</Description>

    <Description>You are bidding on a NEW pair of Kids Athletic cross training shoes by New Balance. The model number is KX889BP. Size is kids size 13-1/2. Shoe is much prettier than the picture shows - multiple shades of grey, black with a silver thread, and royal blue trim. Shoe also has areas of the 3M Scotchlite reflective material. This material enhances safety at night and in low visibility situations, creating a bright image by returning light back to the light source: for example vehicle headlights. Absolutely brand new in a new crisp factory box. Great for Christmas. At this price, you can afford to buy the size your child currently needs and also the size they will grow into next. Check my other auctions for other sizes - I have them all. ***If you do not have a US shipping address, please do not bid on this item.*** Shipping/Handling charge is $6.00 for insured US Mail. You may pay for your purchase with PayPal, check or money order. I will try to get your item into the mail within 24 hours of receipt of your payment (unless you have horrid feedback and you paid by check). Check my other auctions. I have a lot of listings featuring a wide variety of different kinds of merchandise. Buy more than one item and save on shipping. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

I take lots of pics of items before they are shipped! Some items have labels and care tags and some don't. Either they were removed by the manufacturer or me because they itched. I remember where I buy everything. If having that label is important to you, don't bid and go buy full price at the store. I accept PayPal and electronic check payments through Billpoint ONLY. NO exceptions. I require PayPal and Billpoint for YOUR protection as you can confirm payment. PayPal payments should be sent to livtrev@aol.com Payment to be received in 5 days.

After 10 days, the item goes back up for auction or to the next highest bidder and I will leave appropriate feedback. I have been lax on this lately giving everyone a break and listening to sob stories about how they can't get PayPal to work correctly. I have many wonderful repeat bidder's who never seem to have a problem with PayPal and sending payments. Please DO NOT email me after auction close and ask me what is the total or an address to send a Money Order or check as I do not accept them. The total is your winning bid amount plus the listed shipping charges. By submitting your bid, you are agreeing to ALL the above terms. ABOUT US The both of us being compulsive shoppers, we have travelled the world buying all sorts of goodies! From clothing to antiques to collectibles - we buy it all! Problem is, we live in a condo and so we have to rotate out items to make room for new items! As far as the clothing, the great majority of them were bought AT the retailer or from the retailer at FULL PRICE. I will resell items that I have purchased from other great sellers that did not fit us or fullfill our own needs. I have a bad habit of buying things without trying them on or on a whim and being too lazy to return it if it doesn't work out. We also bring you fashions from ALL OVER THE GLOBE. As frequent traveller's, many items come from London, Hamburg, Amsterdam, Paris, Bangkok, Tokyo, Mexico and India.....Seattle, New York, Los Angeles, Chicago &amp; San Francisco! Many articles of clothing or accesories have been handmade expressly for me for quite a bit of money. We don't but cheap, poorly made items. For as many designer labels we have, we also have one of a kind items too!. As part-time musicians subject to a globally diverse group of people with different looks of style and fashion, we bring to you some of the hippest, UNIQUE items that you don't always see everywhere else! STAND OUT FROM THE REST OF THE CROWD! And if we're selling it, you should be sure it's passed our "fashionably acceptable" standards! We are not "Power Seller's" nor is this a "business". I doubt we are actually breaking even. Please keep that in mind. So check back frequently at other items I might be selling as we are CONSTANTLY having to rotate out things in the place! Good luck. Be Safe. God Bless. Email me at livtrev@aol.com if you have any questions! God Bless America! Thanks for checking out Liv &amp; Trev's Closet!!

    <Description>BEAUTIFUL Long Red Sweater (Jacket) Sz M / L ! This is a beautiful long red sweater! It is made by Sideffects and it is a Size Medium. It looks to run a little big though so please check the measurements. It has a nice, fold down collar, side pockets and the end of the sleeves are narrower for a good fit at the end of the arm. The color is pretty close to a true shade of red and it also has shoulder pads. It does not close in the front - no buttons, zipper, etc. It is long and warm!! MEASUREMENTS: 23 inches from underarm to underarm (one way), Overall Length - 37 inches. FABRIC: 100% Acrylic. CONDITION: No holes, rips or stains. It does have some minor pulls but it is hard to see them because of the way it is made. It is in VERY GOOD Condition! Buyer to pay $5.75 shipping - it is a pretty heavy sweater. (Please keep in mind that outfits weigh more therefore shipping is higher for them.) We use priority shipping for most clothing, as we have found that there is only a few cents difference between priority &amp; standard shipping. Plus priority gets the item to you much faster! Canadian Bidders will need to contact me for shipping charges. Payments from Canada can be made by US Money Orders, Canadian Postal Money Orders in USA funds and Credit Cards through Paypal. US Bidders: We accept Money Orders, Cashier's Checks, Visa and Mastercard through Paypal (all of these payment options ship in 1 to 3 days) and Personal Checks accepted (with at least 25 positive feedback and no negative feedback) but shipment will be held until the check clears. If paying with Paypal, we need your confirmed address with Paypal to be sent with your Paypal payment. Buyer to pay shipping for the first auction (highest shipping amount of combined items), and just $1.00 for each additional auction (in a single shipment/payment). Bid on lots of our auctions and save on shipping! If insurance is desired, please add an additional 1.10. We strive to describe our items as accurately as possible but sometimes minor details can be missed. We will gladly refund your money if we missed listing a defect in the item description. However, you will need to contact us WITHIN 3 days receipt of the item. We want our customers to be HAPPY with their purchase! We truly appreciate your business!!

    <Description>Hello, here I have a beautiful BCBG leather jacket. It is a really nice lighter grey (not metallic blue like the photos show).It is the grey shade that was popular in 70's leather jackets, which makes this jacket very stylish. I bought this off ebay a few months ago, but it did not really fit my chest. I loved this jacket so much that I contemplated getting a reduction! Anyways, this is my loss and your gain! I paid a lot for this!! It is a size 8 and it is 36" across the chest,and it's 28" long. It is a very sexy fit because it comes in at the waist to emphasize curves. The leather shows absolutely no wear. The lining is 100% acetate, which feels just like satin, and it is cream. BCBG is a great French label that are known for their sophisticated designs and superior quality. I have to say that I do not think you will ever come across a better deal than this one. I am sorry about the bad photos, they do not do this jacket justice. Please email me with any questions you have. There is still time to get this item for Christmas, so if you are a great friend/relative (or you want to buy yourself a deserving gift) than you have to pick this up! Thank you for looking and good luck!</Description>

    <Description>This is a new, short sleeve, super comfy white maternity top from the GAP. It is from the GAP distribution center near my home and is NOT defective in any way. (Please see my rating and bid with confidence.) This top is so soft and stretchy! It's made of a 92% cotton 8% lycra/spandex blend (stretchy T-shirt like material) and would look equally as good at the office (maybe under a sweater or jacket) as it would with a great pair of jeans! This top is a GAP Maternity Small. Thx for looking and have fun eBaying! :)</Description>

    <Description>This First Option Too! brand jacket is lovely. It is purple chenille yarn woven over a black woven shell and looks like a boucle-type fabric. It has 5 buttons (a spare is included separately), and a collar. It is very lovely and could be worn with black pants to complete a very professional look for work. It measures 25 inches in length from the back collar seam, 19 inches across the shoulders, and 25 inch long sleeves from the shoulder. I bought it on eBay about two months ago but find that it is too small for me around the hips. I removed the tags but will include them with the item. Shipping and insurance to anywhere in the continental USA is $6.60. Winning bidder outside of continental USA will pay actual shipping costs plus insurance. Payment methods preferred are PayPal (non-credit card if possible), money order, or personal check which delays shipping until cleared. Thank you for looking, and happy eBaying, holidays, and new year!</Description>

    <Description>Here we have an authentic Louis Vuitton handbag - the Speedy, Model # M41526, measuring 12 x 8 inches. Great shape for its vintage! Made in France model with its serial no/date stamp inside on leather tabs. The few flaws I can find are: the handles have darkened from use as is common in vintage Vuitton bags, there is no key for the lock, the leather pull for the top zipper has come off (I still have the pull and it will be included - this can be repaired at LV Boutique). The inside canvas lining has a few ink marks but VERY CLEAN - see picture, little wear on corners. These are the only flaws I can find on the bag. Measurements again, are 12" wide, 8" tall, and 8" deep (measuring across the bottom). All of the brass hardware has Louis Vuitton stamped on it. Buyer will pay a fixed shipping of $8.50, which includes insurance. I accept paypal, billpoint, cashier's check and money order and ship immediately. International fees will apply.

This incredible example of Pal Zileri tailoring skill is marked a Euro 52 and measures an American 42. It is a traditionally styled, single-breasted SINGLE button "dinner jacket"......It is in excellent condition with no flaws- really undetectable from new - was not worn more than 2-3 times The fabric - A pure lightweight worsted wool. Althought the thread count is not listed it is at least super 100's. The color is jet black, with a tiny,elegant,sophisticcated counter-grain weave to give it a 'pinstripe' effect upon close inspection. The pictures by no means do this jacket justice. The jacket measurements are: shoulder seam to shoulder seam across the back at the widest point - 19 3/4, chest - 45, , length from bottom of collar to bottom of coat - 32, sleeves - 24, maximum sleeve length 25.5.The jacket is unvented.
