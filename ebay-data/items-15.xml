    <Description>This is a genuine collectable 18" ALF . He is brown and furry all over and is in fairly good shape, clean with no rips or stains, just lots of wild and crazy brown hair. He is not the best of the Alf's I've seen, but he's not that bad either, as he still has his original tush tag. Alf would be a great addition to any collection or a wonderful gift. If the bidding goes over $12.00, I will include an Orbitor Alf Hand Puppet which has a value of $8.00. S/H will be $5.50. I accept, cash, money orders, or checks(with excellent feedbacks). Thanks for looking and good luck.</Description>

    <Description>"A film of intriguing perversity, DREAMS is about the loves of two women---the owner of a model agency and her top model. On a photographic outing to another city, both have strange one day affairs with married men. The film, as relentless as it is tender, is a deeply probing study into the psychology of desire . BERGMAN'S success is derived from exquisite scenes of austere romanticism and painful irony. Rarely has sexual obsession been so accurately observed. DREAMS is a masterful achievement by one of the cinema's greatest students of human nature. 1955 BW 86min. Subtitiled. This movie was sold at a Video Rental, but appears unused. Buyer pays 5.50 for U.S. priority insured shipping. Please check our other auctions for more rare finds. Thank you for looking!

Most of the horses didn't win, causing Steve to be visited by IRS agent Susan Jacks (Nancy Sinatra). Gale Gordon plays Hepworth, her stuffy supervisor, and William Shallert has the role of Abel Esterlake, former racecar driver who helps Steve on the track. Steve engages in the stock-car races at the Charlotte Speedway to get back the money to keep him and his manager out of jail. Presley delivers 11 songs, the most notable being "Let Yourself Go." Elvis by now was just playing out the innocuous string of movies that his musically insensitive, cigar-chomping manager Colonel Tom Parker had contracted for him. Soon Elvis would undertake the most successful live comeback by any performer in history and leave these trashy features behind. _ _ _ -_NO RESERVE!- NEW!- WINNING BIDDER PAYS $4.50 USA SHIPPING- Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>The Blair Witch Project on DVD Starring: Heather Donahue, et al. Director: Dan Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez Anyone who has even the slightest trouble with insomnia after seeing a horror movie should stay away from The Blair Witch Project--this film will creep under your skin and stay there for days. Credit for the effectiveness of this mock documentary goes to filmmakers Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez, who armed three actors (Heather Donahue, Michael Williams, and Josh Leonard) with video equipment, camping supplies, and rough plot outlines. They then let the trio loose into the Maryland woods to improvise and shoot the entire film themselves as the filmmakers attempted to scare the crap out of them. Gimmicky, yes, but it worked--to the wildly successful tune of $130 million at the box office upon its initial release (the budget was a mere $40,000). For those of you who were under a rock when it first hit the theaters, The Blair Witch Project tracks the doomed quest of three film students shooting a documentary on the Burkittsville, Maryland, legend of the Blair Witch. After filming some local yokels (and providing only scant background on the witch herself), the three, led by Heather (something of a witch herself), head into the woods for some on-location shooting. They're never seen again. What we see is a reconstruction of their "found" footage, edited to make a barely coherent narrative. After losing their way in the forest, whining soon gives way to real terror as the three find themselves stalked by unknown forces that leave piles of rocks outside their campsite and stick-figure art projects in the woods. (As Michael succinctly puts it, "No redneck is this clever!") The masterstroke of the film is that you never actually see what's menacing them; everything is implied, and there's no terror worse than that of the unknown. If you can wade through the tedious arguing--and the shaky, motion-sickness-inducing camerawork--you'll be rewarded with an oppressively sinister atmosphere and one of the most frightening denouements in horror-film history. Even after you take away the monstrous hype, The Blair Witch Project remains a genuine, effective original.

    <Description>Walt Disney's Peter Pan Bursting with pixie dust, adventure and song, Disney's 14th animated masterpiece brings the timeless story of Peter Pan to magical life and reawakens the child in all of us. The fantastical film begins when the hero of Wendy, John and Michael's bedtime stories - Peter Pan, the boy who refuses to grow up - returns to the nursery and invites them on a magical journey to Never Land. With the help of tinker Bell, his feisty sidekick, a dazzling shower of pixie dust and some happy thoughts, Peter teaches them to fly. Off they soar to an enchanted island filled with wonder and adventure. Before they know it, they're knee-deep in a high-flying battle with swashbuckling pirates, led by Peter's archenemy, Captain Hook - Whose time is nearly up against a tick-tocking crocodile. From the stunning scenes of the flight to Never land, to the underground home of the Lost Boys, to the stardust ship in the moonlight - Peter Pan defines Disney magic. And now immortalized for the first time on DVD, this flight of fantasy will captivate your entire family - and remind us all that childhood dreams never die.

    <Description>NEW AND FACTORY SEALED!!! Cardcaptor Sakura-The Movie Enchanted Cards Language Japanese Subtitled : English and are removable Cardcaptor Sakura-The Movie Enchanted Cards : This Anime Puts "Sailor Moon" to Shame! DVD is REGION FREE &amp; will work in ALL dvd players (Works in Playstation 2 also). DVD has selctable subtitles ( English / Chinese / Off ). The audio is in Japanese with Dolby Digital AC-3 5.1 Surround. This DVD is an original DVD, BRAND NEW NEVER USED, it is not a vcd, cd-r copy or bootleg. This DVD includes 1 DVD in box. As I was watching this series, I was struck by how similar it was to "Sailor Moon" -- they're both targeted towards the same pre-teen girl audience, they're both heavy on the magic and romance, and they have very similar character designs. That's why it's so hard to believe how much better than "Sailor Moon" "Card Captor Sakura" is! Though sometimes the story seems repetitive, the animation is just incredible, especially for a tv series. Whereas in "Sailor Moon", you can tell that they're trying to get away with as little animation as possible, "Sakura" is almost lush enough to be put on the big screen. All of the super-cheesy stuff that sometimes made me embarrassed to watch "Sailor Moon" is totally gone. Plus it has better character development, Sakura gets to wear a different battle costume each episode, and there could not possibly be any anime character cuter than Kero-chan. Now, unfortunately, "Card Captor Sakura" is not yet officially available in the US. This is a series that I highly recommend. Accepted payments: Paypal Postal Money Orders Money Orders, Cashier's checks Cash in a concealed envelope Personal Checks 10 day waiting period: and if Buyer feedback is over Fifty no waiting period FOR SHIPPING ADD $2.99 FOR DVD_S (up to 3 to be shipped together). every additional DVD to be shipped with SAME order would be 50 cents each to be shipped with the other 3 DVD_S. . if you have further questions about shipping please e-mail me.

    <Description>WALTHER _ P-99 Replica GAS BLOWBACK SEMI-AUTOMATIC PISTOL Shoots 6mm Paintballs, &amp; Airsoft BB's Comes with EXTRA magazine! ! ! High quality full-size ABS polymer and metal replica of the new pistol design from Walther_, makers of the PPK compact pistol. The P99 is a state-of-the-art autopistol. The P99 has been issued to Agent 007, James Bond . It is James Bond's new sidearm in Tomorrow Never Dies TND, &amp; The World is not Enough TWINE. High quality model has authentic details and is built to scale. Working slide, trigger, magazine and release. There is full-length slide travel on this replica, and the slide stop actually works. Slide automatically locks at rear with an empty magazine, just like a real P99 . Authentic shell ejection port. Realistic removable magazine. Functioning firing pin striker with red dot indicator. Ambidextrous magazine release. Open combat sights. Fine surface texturing, including slide grooves, finger grooves, and non-slip grip surfaces. Color is black, and the finish appears as the genuine article. Length is about 7 inches. This is a gas blowback gun, made by Y &amp; P. When loaded, it will fire 14 shots as fast as you pull the trigger. When the first magazine is empty, slam in the second one and just keep shooting. The slide blows back with every shot! Pistol comes NEW, mint in box with instructions, 100 .2gr BB's, and 2 removable full size clips. Just add gas for everything you need to start having fun! This P99 is one of the most realistic and most detailed replicas available. In fact, many movies and TV Series actually use guns such as these as back up and throw down pieces because of their detail and inexpensive nature. Why destroy a $500 steel blank firing prop when you can have the same amount of detail at well less than half the cost? This replica is composed of tough ABS polymer and metal parts. Do not confuse this with the Tomorrow Never Dies P99 cap gun toy made by Wicke! This is a truly accurate scaled model with the high quality details of the true Walther_ P99 . The top picture is a real P99 . The bottom picture is of this gun. It cannot fire real bullets, and never could. This baby will fool your friends for sure!

    <Description>This auction is for a VHS video in used but good condition. 'Big' stars Tom Hanks and Elizabeth Parkins. "about a 12 year old boy whose wish to be "big" comes true overnight. Suffering the typical frustrations of adolescence, Josh Baskin thinks his problems will disappear if only he were bigger. With a little help from Zoltar, a mechanical carnival genie, Josh wakes up the next day as a 35 year old man. Being a grown-up isn't easy when you've never done it before, but Josh manages to land a job at a toy company. Here his youthful enthusiasm prompts his boss to rapidly promote him and attracts the amorous attentions of a co-worker, but also brings hostility from a spiteful rival. And the more Josh exsperiences the complications of being an adult, the more he begins to yearn for the simple joys of childhood." Rated PG. Runs 104 mins. Shipping via U.S. priority mail @$3.50 and any additional items shipped with this will be an extra $1.35 per item. Sorry, no international orders. Payment by personal check or money order.

    <Description>This is a photo of actress Marion Davies. The negative it was printed from dates to the 1920's or early 30's, but no information is available about this print itself. It is in excellent condition - virtually perfect - but it was certainly printed fairly recently from the look of it. Note that I have some original vintage Hollywood photos up on eBay right now from a private collection, but this is not one of those - still this is a great shot of her, though! Dimensions are 8 x 10 inches. Buyer adds 2.00 shipping within the U.S. (Shipping and handling to all other countries will be four dollars) - if you win more than one of my photo auctions you pay only shipping on one.

    <Description>Carole Landis - Inscribed, Signed Photo In 1935, after high school and brief marriage in San Bernardino, California, Frances Ridste ran away to San Francisco to work as nightclub dancer and band singer under a self-coined stage name, Carole Landis. In Hollywood as extra from 1936 (age 18), she won a Warner Brothers contract in 1937, which ended after 15 films as bit player and Busby Berkeley chorine. Her "break" came when Hal Roach cast her in the skin-clad lead of his hit 'One Million B.C. (1940)' and in 3 fine comedies, then sold her contract to 20th Century Fox. She played "B" leads and "A" supporting roles in her first 12 Fox films, with a notable dramatic performance in 'I Wake Up Screaming (1941)'. Critics dwelled on her beauty, seldom mentioning her acting and comedy potential. Unusual Woman A feminist at a young age, she once tried to start a girls football at school but got into trouble because it was considered "un-lady like" Two older siblings: Dorothy Ridste Ross, born 1917, and Lawrence Ridste. Carole protested strongly and publicly against the nonsensical nickname 'Ping Girl' coined by Hal Roach publicist Frank Seltzer.in April 1940. In her musicals, Carole usually sang in her own voice. A keen amateur photographer, she developed her own pictures. She initiated divorce proceedings against her last husband in March 1948 but the divorce was not final when she died. NO RESERVE UNCONDITIONAL GUARANTEE Carole wrote a book about her first wartime USO tour, entertaining troops in England and North Africa; in the film version, 'Four Jills in a Jeep (1944)', we first glimpse her mature talent. Absent most of that year on USO work in the Pacific, she returned weakened by amoebic dysentery, malaria, and near-fatal pneumonia to find the film dismissed as "self-praise". After 'Having Wonderful Crime (1945)', perhaps her best comedy, and two B-films, her Fox contract was dropped. Ostracized in Hollywood due to her ardent feminism and rumors about sexual episodes, she made her last two films in England. With a stalled career, health poor, marriages failed, short of money, and the end in sight of a love affair with married Rex Harrison she committed suicide with Seconal in 1948. Intelligent, generous, talented and gorgeous, she was 29.

    <Description>CAR TROUBLE, starring Julie Walters and Ian Charleson, is a hilarious comedy about a man who loved his car until his wife, her lover, and a tow truck came between them. Gerald's frenzied passion for his hot wheels causes him to revoke Jacqueline's driving priveges. She retaliates by seducing their leather-jacketed car salesman - and getting stuck in a compromising position- trapped in Gerald's car. If only the fire department and news team hadn't shown up, Gerald would have never known! A very clever, well-done comedy. Color, 1986, 93 minutes, rated R. This video is a former rental but is in excellent condition with one large sticker. The box is in good condition with some wear on the edges and some light scratches on the front. Buyer should add $3.00 s/h. It is suggested that the buyer add $1.10 or the appropriate amount for insurance since I will not be responsible for errors by the post office. Money order, check, or Visa/Mastercard through PayPal. 14-day refund guarantee if you are not satisfied. Thanks for looking.</Description>

    <Description>This auction is for a previously viewed VHS tape of the 1999 hit "Eyes Wide Shut", starring Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman and directed by Stanley Kubrick. This video is rated "R", is in color and runs 159 minutes. The back of the box says the following: "Cruise plays Dr. William Harford, a New Yorker who plunges one fateful winter night into an erotic foray that threatens his marriage-- and may ensnare him in a lurid murder mystery-- after his wife's(Kidman)admission of sexual longings. As the story sweeps from doubt and fear to self-discovery and reconciliation, Kubrick orchestrates it with masterful flourishes. Graceful tracking shots, controlled pacing, rich colors, startling images:bravura traits that make Kubrick a filmmaker for the ages are here to keep everyone's eyes wide open." The winning bidder will pay USPS Priority shipping, and I will ship the day after I receive payment. I accept Paypal, eBay Online Payments(Billpoint) and money orders.

    <Description>GOD BLESS AMERICA --------- THIS DVD IS FROM THE CRITERION COLLECTION. CRITERION OFFERS FILM CLASSICS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD PRESENTED WITH SUCH EXTRAORDINARY VIDEO AND AUDIO FIDELITY AS TO BE UNPARALLELED ANYWHERE. THIS EXTREMELY COSTLY SCIENTIFIC PRECISION BRINGS THESE FILMS TO LIFE AND TRANSPORTS YOU TO THE FRONT ROW OF THE ORIGINAL THEATRICAL RELEASE - EVEN IF THAT RELEASE WAS 1926. THE ENHANCED EXTRAS ON THESE CRITERION RELEASES ARE OFTEN AS ABSORBING AS THE FILM ITSELF. WHEN YOU CARE ENOUGH TO GIVE THE VERY BEST, GIVE CRITERION! THE CRITERION COLLECTION IS PROUD TO PRESENT A SPECIAL EDITION PRESTON STURGES' THE LADY EVE BARBARA STANWYCK HENRY FONDA CHARLES COBURN WILLIAM DEMAREST LUCILLE BALL ONCE SAID SHE LEARNED ABOUT PERFORMING COMEDY IN FILM BY STUDYING STANWYCK IN "THE LADY EVE" THIS EDITION IS UNRATED ROGER EBERT, Chicago Sun-Times: "If I were asked to name the single scene in the history of romantic comedy that was sexiest and funniest at the same time, I would advise beginning at six seconds past the 20-minute mark in Preston Sturges' The Lady Eve, and watching as Barbara Stanwyck toys with Henry Fonda's hair in an unbroken shot that lasts three minutes and 51 seconds. "Stanwyck [gives] one of her greatest performances, a flight of romance and comedy so graceful and effortless that she is somehow able to play different notes at the same time. "As good as Fonda is, The Lady Eve is all Stanwyck's; the love, the hurt and the anger of her character provide the motivation for nearly every scene, and what is surprising is how much genuine feeling she finds in the comedy. "The Stanwyck character's masquerade sets up the two final lines of the film, which I will not mention here-- except to say that for my money, either one is equal to the classic line "nobody's perfect!" at the end of "Some Like It Hot." TV GUIDE: "THE LADY EVE is one of Sturges' best romantic comedies, with just the right blend of satire and slapstick, the laughs coming mostly from his clever, often inspired comedic lines. His direction is flawless, and the cast, from stars to stock players, performs beautifully. Stanwyck, is particular, is an effortless comedienne. "It's a daring, roguish display of her talent; one can't imagine any comedienne-- even Colbert or Russell--bringing it off as she does. Sturges, who began as a contract scriptwriter for Paramount, promised Stanwyck that he would write a great comedy for her some day, and she got it." TOM DIRKS, The Greatest Films: "The Lady Eve is a sophisticated romantic/sex comedy (with light romance and mock seduction scenes) - a classic screwball film, a quintessential Preston Sturges work of art and the director's first real commercial hit. "Barbara Stanwyck proves, once and for all, she stands tallest among the great film comediennes." LEONARD MALTIN: "Stanwyck is a con artist who sets her eyes on wealthy Fonda-- the dolt to end all dolts, who proclaims "snakes are my life." "This film grows funnier with each viewing-- thanks to Sturges's script, breathless pace, and two incomparable stars." DIALOGUE Charles Pike (Fonda): You ought to put handles on that skull. Maybe you could grow geraniums in it. ------------------------- Charles Pike: You're certainly a funny girl for anybody to meet who's just been up the Amazon for a year. Jane Harrington (Stanwyck): Good thing you weren't up there two years. ------------------------- Jane Harrington: You see Hopsi, you don't know very much about girls. The best ones aren't as good as you think they are and the bad ones aren't as bad. Not nearly as bad. ------------------------- Charles Pike: What I am trying to say is: I'm not a poet, I'm an ophiologist. ------------------------- Jane Harrington: You know Charles? Sir Alfred McGlennan (Eric Blore): Oh, is he the tall backwards boy always toying with toads and things? Yes, I think I have seen him scouting about. Jane Harrington: He's not backwards. He's a scientist. Sir Alfred McGlennan: Oh is that what it is? I knew he was, mm... peculiar. ------------------------- Jane Harrington: Boy, would I like to see you give some old harpie the thrill! "Colonel" Harrington (Charles Coburn): Don't be vulgar, Jane. Let us be crooked, but never common. ------------------------- Jane Harrington: I don't see why I have to do all the dirty work. There must be plenty of rich old dames waiting for you to push them around. "Colonel" Harrington: You find them, I'll push them. ------------------------- Jane Harrington: I need him like the ax needs the turkey. ------------------------- The Stewart: Good morning, sir. Fruit, cereal, bacon and egg, egg and sausage, sausage and hot cake, hot cake and ham, ham and egg, egg and bacon, bacon and... Muggsy (William Demarest): [Hungover] Give me a spoonful of milk, a raw pigeon's egg, and four houseflies. If you can't catch any, I'll settle for a cockroach.

METRO GOLDWYN MAYER PRESENTS THE WIDESCREEN PRESENTATION QUIGLEY DOWN UNDER STARRING TOM SELLECK LAURA SAN GIACOMO ALAN RICKMAN ROGER EBERT, Chicago Sun-Times: "'Quigley Down Under' stars Tom Selleck, an actor who with his height, authority and natural ease might have been a major Western star in the old days. "I admired Alan Rickman's performance as the villain. He has a polished grace that serves here to suggest evil dimensions just beneath the surface. "I also enjoyed, in a visceral way, the pleasures of seeing the visual beauties of a Western. The choreography of a gunfight in rocky foothills. The excitement of a chase on horseback. The ambushes and close calls and treks through the desert land. "'Quigley Down Under' is a handsome, well-acted film." TODD GORMAN, StarFilm Reviews: "Quigley Down Under is a very pleasant surprise. Essentially it_s a Western with Tom Selleck as the eponymous hero who takes himself to the Australian Outback like a cowboy Crocodile Dundee in reverse. There is an offbeat quirky love story too. "With his neatly trimmed beard, cowboy hat and huge six-foot rifle, Quigley cuts a very imposing dash when he steps off the boat in Western Australia. "It_s the 1860s and he_s been hired after answering a newspaper advertisement looking for _the best long-distance sharpshooter in the world_. "This is a hugely enjoyable film with all kinds of traditional heroic resonances. "An authoritative Selleck is wholeheartedly into his role as a laconic but highly moral Western hero. "Lots of spectacular rugged landscapes, an uplifting musical score and some perfectly judged dramatic moments complete a movie which manages to be very entertaining."

    <Description>I was very fortunate, as a HUGE Lucy fan, to attend the Loving Lucy Convention this August in Burbank, CA! While there, I was able to purchase some of these cups and saucers. They are "old" , and not reproductions!!They are identical to the ones used in every episode of I Love Lucy, and she also had this pattern in her own home as well! This cup and saucer is NOT, I repeat, NOT the originals, but, ARE the same pattern, company and age of the ones used...the exact ones! I have kept a set for myself, for when my best friend comes over for coffee...for our "own" Lucy &amp; Ethel moments! I will also include a copy of this picture showing Lucy &amp; Ethel sitting over a cup of coffee using these dishes. I will be listing a few others shortly, so you will have the opportunity to own more than one cup and saucer if you wish.Also, I will be listing other "pieces" from this collection..ie cream &amp; sugar set..plates etc...the same pattern and the same age, as well as the SAME coffee perculator that she uses on I Love Lucy as well!! It is really,really cool!!! If you are anywhere near a Lucy fan as I, I am positive you will be just "Thrilled" to own these dishes..to create your own Lucy/Ethel Moments!! I ship worldwide, take Paypal, cashiers chq or money order. Thank you, and I hope you have a "Ball"!!</Description>

    <Description>THIS IS A BRAND NEW AND STILL FACTORY SEALED VIDEO. "ON THE TOWN" Stars Gene Kelly, Alice Pearce, Ann Miller, Betty Garrett, Florence Bates, Frank Sinatra, Jules Munshin, Vera Ellen Film Credits Arthur Freed Producer Adolph Green Screenwriter Betty Comden Screenwriter Harold Rosson Director of Photography Cedric Gibbons Production Designer Ralph E. Winters Editor Synopsis Eager to experience it all, three sailors are determined to find love and adventure during their 24-hour leave in New York City. Carrying with them good hearts, great voices, and delightful dance steps, the navy men encounter and charm lovely ladies and colorful characters. ON THE TOWN is a classic musical that perfectly balances song with story, love with camaraderie while showing off the remarkable dancing of Gene Kelly and Frank Sinatra_s unforgettable voice. Description Codirectors Gene Kelly and Stanley Donen (SINGIN_ IN THE RAIN) also choreographed this musical classic following three sailors docked in New York City for 24 hours. New to town and ready to see the sights--and the girls--Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin search for adventure in the Big Apple. Wooing the ladies with their singing and dancing and being charmed in return, the trio finds various degrees of romantic success. But as all good things must come to an end, the navy men return to their ship, leaving behind them a city briefly brighter and taking with them a heartful of memories. Dancing by the marvelous and masculine Kelly and singing by heartthrob Sinatra (looking very young!) add punch and pizzazz to the musical numbers, including the famous "New York, New York" scene. ON THE TOWN was one of the first movies filmed on location in New York--a wild extravagance in those days--and the extra effort taken shows in every shot of the film. Film Notes The film contains remarkable location footage of New York City. Shooting outside of the studio was a rarity at that time, and Gene Kelly had to fight for permission to do so. As it was, the crew had to be careful about when and where they shot given the stars' fame--especially Sinatra's. The film is based on the Broadway musical, which premiered in December 1944; that show, in turn, was inspired by Jerome Robbins's short ballet, "Fancy Free." Among the stars of the show were ballerina Sono Osato (as Ivy Smith), the play's writers Betty Comden and Adolph Green (as Claire and Ozzy), and Nancy Walker (as Hildy). It was a first for most of the show's young cast and creators, the majority of whom had not yet celebrated their 30th birthdays: It marked the Broadway debut for choreographer Robbins, composer Leonard Bernstein, and playwrights Comden and Green. Only director George Abbott was a theater veteran. ON THE TOWN was also a first in other respects--most importantly, as the first Broadway musical to have an interracial chorus and to employ a black conductor/musical director. Reportedly, when Louis B. Mayer, head of MGM, saw the show (which he had already bought the movie rights to), he considered it "communist" because of a duet danced by an interracial couple. Much of Leonard Bernstein's Broadway score was scrapped for the film, which ultimately contained only four of his original songs. New songs were written by Roger Edens. MGM was not alone in wanting the film rights to ON THE TOWN. In fact, Mayer and the other executives had to wrench them from another studio, which had already purchased them. This was the first time that a bidding war had erupted prior to a Broadway show's opening; most of the interest was generated by the popularity of Jerome Robbins's ballet.

    <Description>The Big Red One - Original 1980 Lee Marvin war movie poster, 1-sheet, 27X41, folded at distrib, great shape. The Gene (brother of Roger) Corman production starred the mighty Lee Marvin, Robert Carradine, &amp; Mark Hamill, and was written and directed by Sam Fuller, who knew his way around a war movie far shore. Photostyle design...our guys in barracks mugging in sepia tones, then front of them, slashed, almost-bomb-shape design of each guy again, this time in color and uniform. "Only chance could have thrown them together. Now, nothing can pull them apart." All this and World War Two. We accept money orders and PayPal. U.S. orders need $3.50 for American priority mail, normally 2-3 days continental shipping. Non-PayPal international orders need international money orders made out to U.S. funds, or U.S. funds shipped securely, best via registered mail. (State your choice of shipping, air, surface, witchever, and we get back to you on freight rate to add to cost of item.) PA. residents add 6% sales tax. We normally wait 10 days from auction sale date for payment on domestic orders, then we start thinking about relisting and dropping bat, er, bad feedback. Foreign orders we with more patience abat, uh, abide. We've been doing movie poster mail order for 18 years, been in the biz 19, and we're known for fast, friendly service. Not to mention rapid respuns. (Ah, yes, anything with Lee Marvin on it, I could use a "Dirty Dozen" of 'em...) Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>This auction is for a Rare Buffy - Angel WB Crossover Event. It is a VHS NTSC video which came from a WB station, Not from the store. This was given to stations for promotions. Rare because the shows haven_t been fully edited for air. In _Pangs_ (Buffy) and in _I Will Remember You" (Angel) the fight scenes have not had all the audio added yet. Which makes it kind funny to watch and not hear punching or swords clanging ect. ect. . The same is for all the special effects. They are there, but they are not finished yet. And you can see some really bad green screen effects shots where the final ones will go. Watch buffys hand disappear and reappears and the vampire she kills fall forward and disappear (with out the skeleton_s falling apart) in the tease before the show starts. Buffy doesn_t have credits on the end instead it has a slate shot that says credits 30 sec. And Angles credits are x out with a big red x as well as some of the special effects. The cassette doesn_t have a logo on it. It has a white label with Buffy The Vampire Slayer/Angel, Special Two Hour Event, Tuesday, November 23 1999, (8:00-10:00pm et), TRT (Total running time) 90:20 It comes in the original cassette box that came to the station. It_s a cheaper plastic then normal because these were Intended to be thrown away or recycled and taped over. Full color insert with a picture of buffy and Angel with the show logos and on the top it says, A spectacular Two-Hour Event that Reunites Buffy and Angel. On the bottom it has each of them as special guests for each show. The air date of Tuesday, November 23 and the show times. This is great item for any Buffy / Angel collector.

    <Description>Please check out our Ebay Store for more great Videos and DVDs. The Little Rascals Volume 8 (1929-44) - vhs VHS is in good condition and includes original case. Unless otherwise stated. Volume 8: Shiver My Timbers/ Choo-Choo!/ Divot Diggers/ Bored Of Education Shiver My Timbers: The gang is playing hooky again- how unusual. This time, they're down at the docks dreaming of life on the high seas. Their dreams come true- but one wild night on the water shipwrecks their desires. Choo-Choo!: When Stymie, Wheezer, Brisbane and the gang trade places with a group of orphans on a train, it spells trouble for everyone on the track, especially the kid's guardian- the hopeless, hapless, helpless Mr. Henderson. Divot Diggers: The gang is on the links- and on the brink of a riot. Homemade clubs, a runaway lawn mower, Jiggs the chimp, confounded club members, and above-par gags are the course for this unforgettable round of chaos, calamity and confusion. Bored Of Education: As usual, Spanky and Alfalfa want no part of school. But when Miss Lawrence catches on to their fake toothache scheme, the boys get a nasty taste of their own medicine.

    <Description>test _ Shanghai Express - 1932 Here is a NEAR MINT condition print of Marlene Dietrich, Clive Brook, Warner (Charlie Chan) Oland and Eugene Pallette in Josef von Sternberg' 1932 tale of adventure, love and danger - Shanghai Express!_ Many passengers on the Shanghai Express are more concerned that the notorious Shanghai Lily (Dietrich) is on board than the fact that a civil war is going on that may make the trip take more than three days. The British Army doctor, Donald Harvey, knew Lily before she became a famous "coaster." A fellow passenger defines a coaster as "a woman who lives by her wits along the China coast." When Chinese guerillas stop the train, Dr. Harvey is selected as the hostage. Lily saves him, but can she make him believe that she really hasn't changed from the woman he loved five years before? Click Here for a complete description of the movie, including cast and credits, from the Internet Movie Database. The film is printed on a B/W sound film stock identified only as "K5 178"._ The film opens with the MCA/Paramount logo and ends with Paramount logo and Cast of Characters title card._ This appears to be an ORIGINAL TV print and is in NEAR MINT CONDITION ._ The picture is very sharp and the sound is very strong._ I noticed what might be described as a tiny bit of "wow" in Reel 1 which may or may not be in the print - it's only noticable during the music in the opening credits and during a scene where a bell is ringing._ It's very minor and of course does not effect the dialogue at all._ There are no lines or scratches in this physical print, although there is a very fine light printed in on Reel 2 which comes and goes._ There are three physical splices in Reel 1 (one is a changeover splice) and one splice (also a changeover) in Reel 2._ You will not be disappointed in this print, which would make a fine addition to any collectors library!_ The film is complete with new leaders, comes on two 1600'_ reels, and is ready to be projected. I am offering this print with NO RESERVE , and it is well worth the opening price._ This print is sold from one collector to another with with no rights given or implied. I accept payment via PayPal (preferred), Billpoint, Bidpay and will also accept checks and money orders._ Checks require 10 business days to clear._ By bidding on this auction you agree to make payment using one of the methods stated above in such a way that payment reaches me not later than 7 days after the close of the auction._ Please keep this in mind if you are using checks or money orders and allow yourself sufficient time for them to reach me through the mail. I ship in the United States via UPS only, and charge a flat rate of $12.00 per feature to the lower 48 states (Alaska and Hawaii cost substantially more, but you may elect delivery buy USPS)._ International Shipments will be by USPS ONLY and will be billed at actual cost._ You agree to pay all required shipping charges at the time you make payment for this auction._ Please NOTE that I only ship on Friday and Saturday. BID WITH CONFIDENCE as I GUARANTEE that the film will be in the condition stated above or I will gladly refund your purchase price._ I do not refund shipping costs, unless a condition should arise where I have made a gross error or omission in disclosing the condition of a film (in which case shipping costs both ways will be refunded, at my discretion).

    <Description>Hello, this beach towel is about 62" X 3'. I couldn't get the whole towel in the photo. It is desighned like a T.V. guide from the 60s or early 70s. Some of the shows that didn't show in my photo include "Camp Runamuck, Hank, Convoy, Mister Roberts, Man from U.N.C.L.E., Flipper , I dream of Jeannie, Get smart, Saterday night at the movies". It appears to have been uesed and washed as it's alittle faded but is in overall good condition. There is roughly a 1/2" stain, and another light stain. This item came from a well connected person who worked in the T.V. industry years ago. I accept money orders and Bidpay. Free Honesty Counters powered by Andale!

    <Description>Then you should get a kick out of this one! fans of the offbeat and bruce Dern should like this western.this movie plays out like kind of a chess game between pat garrete and billy the kid,with whole trains and towns as pices. kirk douglas plays the railroad backed 'all guns, guts, and glory'marshal Nightingale who at a closer look reveals a darker side.his ambition makes him even worse than pat garrette.all he really cares about is winning a election to become a powerful U.S. senator.Evidence of this is in the way he makes arrests;his professionism is thrown out the window-He uses a Janet Reno style method to catch outlaws,taking no prisioners,caring little about taking them in alive,or recovering robbery mony. The two people who see through him the most are Dern,and a local journalist,who having lost limbs in war hates railroads and ambitous people.Kind of like the old Hamilton vs Jefferson;Hamilton represnting big banking and progress-while others dont like it they know its the way of the future.Many people dident like RxR's either. Bruce Dern is the outlaw Strawhorn,with a great understanding of human nature.Evidence of this is in the scence where just after shooting someone,in front of a horrified crowd,he shuts up a barking dog by throwing him a pice of meat.always trying to cloud good and evil,one of his most memorble quotes is when he tells Nightingale:'honest men only stay honest til it stops paying,thats why your a liar and Im a theif.' Nightingales' plan is simple:elimiate strawhorns gang, and to get elected-capture Strawhorn himself- simple plan but he finds it not as simple to carry out. After a member of Nightingales own posse ponders his future because he is an indian(Indians were often hired by the white man often performing beyond expectations but once the mission was over they were left out to dry)sets the scence to the climatic ending-its Stawhorn vs Nightingale: a chess match playing itself out to the end! Another quote I liked was 'what do we pay taxes for?' If you never saw this movie before try starting it 105 minutes into the movie then watch it again. Another offbeat Kirk Douglas western I would recomend is 'Lonely are the brave' with walter Mathau as sheriff. Shipping and Handling $2.75</Description>

I have an original 1968 3-Sheet movie poster from the CLIVE DONNER directed comedy HERE WE GO ROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH , starring BARRY EVANS, JUDY GEESON, ANGELA SCOULAR and SHEILA WHITE.

This poster comes in two pieces which fit together to form the 3-sheet which measures 40 x 78. It is in near mint condition. IT IS "FOLDED" AS ALL POSTERS WERE FROM THAT VINTAGE PERIOD. Theatre Lobby posters, as you probably know, hang in the theatre lobbies prior and during the screening of the film. Buyer pays shipping of $6 U.S. and Canada, $20 all other destinations. The poster will be securely wrapped in Poly-Urethane and shipped in a crush proof tube. Our company has had hunders of positive feedbacks for our shipping.

Brown) falls for "Daphne," and a mob boss (George Raft) refuses to fall for their hoax!

    <Description>LD - Mint Condition Widescreen Edition THX Laserdisc in heavy duty plastic protective sleeve. Stars: Billy Crystal, Bruno Kirby, Daniel Stern, David Paymer, Helen Slater, Jack Palance, Patricia Wettig, Tracey Walter Synopsis: Three male friends, facing their 40th birthdays and experiencing midlife crises, decide they need time away from their "soft" city lives. Fans of old western films, particularly John Wayne's "Red River," they decide to vacation at a dude ranch, where they will be responsible for a two-week long cattle drive through the Colorado hills. Along the way the urban cowboys encounter bad weather, macho, gun-wielding ranchers, and pregnant cattle, but they finish the drive with their lives back on track. Description: When a thoroughly urbanized executive is struggling to find meaning in his life, his two best friends find the perfect cure: a fantasy cowboy vacation. The three friends then rope and ride their way down a trail that leads to a better understanding of themselves and each other. Academy Awards: Best Supporting Actor--Jack Palance.

    <Description>I will never forget the time I met Tim. It was in 1962. I was on the school bus going to school. As we passed a local motel there sit his touring bus. I had the driver to stop the bus and let me off. I walked back to the motel and waited for Tim to come out. I ran up to him with my hand out to shake his. He in return shook my hand. I told him what I had done to get to meet him and he thought it was rather amusing that I played hookey that day just to meet him. We talked for awhile and then he had to leave. You know I would do it all over again, it was well worth it. Great for framing. S/H is $3.00 unlimited amount..S/H same for Canada.. Look thru all my auctions for your favorite Western Star.

    <Description>Reebok Step REEBOK Extreme Step Workout VHS Video THIS VIDEO IS BRAND NEW, FACTORY SEALED!! This is no ordinary up-up-down-down! Coordination, step experience, and love of dance are definitely required for this highly choreographed step workout. Petra Kolber is an excellent, creative instructor. She aims this 50-minute video at the advanced step aerobics enthusiast (or step instructor) who is hungry for more, more, more dance-oriented, complex, step choreography with rhythm variations. She packs so much choreography into this tape that she doesn't spend much time "teaching" the patterns. She does break each pattern down and teaches it at half-speed a couple of times, but you'll probably have to stop the video a number of times at first in order to learn the routines. Once you've learned them, you'll have a blast with these innovative moves and patterns. Recommended for advanced steppers and instructors. Paypal ,Checks, Money orders only . I do not accept Billpoint, Bidpay or credit cards. If you have negative feedback for non-payment your bid will be rejected. FREE SHIPPING IN THE US. International shipping is 8.50.

    <Description>I came across a great box of paper goods a few years ago. Otherwise, I would never have picked this ledger up- ledgers are pretty boring, as a rule. This is pretty interesting, though. It lists all the expenses for a movie theater for the peiod 1927-1929. There is no ticket sales information. For example, Miss S. Dorfman received 8.00 per week as cashier and E.H. Dowding received 20.00 per week as organist. The best pages are those that list the movie rentals. Films were obtained from Fox, Plathe, Universal, MGM and other agencies. Fees ran from 2.00 to 20.00. This was a pretty low budget theater, because the majority of films were the inexpensive serials and curiosities. But most the big names seem to appear somewhere- Our Gang, Hoot Gibson, Tom Mix, Rudolph Valentino, Wallace Beery, Douglas Fairbanks and on and on. This was pretty much a shoe-string operation and not much record keeping was done. There are about 250 pages and only about 40 have been written on. The most writing has to do with the movies and many of these pages have been written on both sides. Only a true devotee will recognize many of the cheaper titles. My photo shows the best page and I think almost everyone is familiar with the stars and titles. There is no personal, business or theater name in the ledger. I found the 2 playbills in the same box. They were the only similar items in the box, but that is no guarantee that they are related, except the items seemed to be personal effects rather than a collection. I could not match up any rental information with the playbill dates. The playbills are for the Gayety Theater located at 2407 Central Avenue. There is no city listed. The listed movies are some of the better known films and actors including Charlie Chaplin in 'The Circus' and Victor McLaglen in 'Strong Boy.' Matinees were on Sunday with candy for the children. The playbills are in very poor condition- the edges are all damaged. The ledger is basically pretty good, but has surface soil. These are heavy, so shipping will be approximately 8-10.00 depending on destination. PLease contct me with any questions. Thank you for looking. NO PAYPAL ON SALES UNDER 25.00. PLEASE DO NOT USE CHECK-OUT. I WILL CONTACT YOU WITHIN 24 HOURS OF AUCTION END.</Description>

On the right side it reads"J.J. Born, president, Chicago Historical Antique Automobile Museum, Inc., announces the first exclusive museum showing of the radically styled Banacek tv car hijacked for ranson that had to be found by the famed insurance investigator, Banacek, played by actor George Peppard.
